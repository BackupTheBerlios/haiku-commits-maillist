</I>&gt;<i> Log:
</I>&gt;<i> mmlr+anevilyak:
</I>&gt;<i> * Keep track of the currently running threads.
</I>&gt;<i> * Make use of that info to decide if a thread that becomes ready 
</I>&gt;<i> should preempt
</I>&gt;<i>   the running thread.
</I>&gt;<i> * If we should preempt we send the target CPU a reschedule message.
</I>&gt;<i> * This preemption strategy makes keeping track of idle CPUs by means 
</I>&gt;<i> of a bitmap
</I>&gt;<i>   superflous and it is therefore removed.
</I>&gt;<i> * Right now only other CPUs are preempted though, not the current 
</I>&gt;<i> one.
</I>&gt;<i> * Add missing initialization of the quantum tracking code.
</I>&gt;<i> * Do not extend the quantum of the idle thread based quantum tracking 
</I>&gt;<i> as we want
</I>&gt;<i>   it to not run longer than necessary. Once the preemption works 
</I>&gt;<i> completely
</I>&gt;<i>   adding a quantum timer for the idle thread will become unnecessary 
</I>&gt;<i> though.
</I>&gt;<i> * Fix thread stealing code, it did missed the last thread in the run 
</I>&gt;<i> queue.
</I>&gt;<i> * When stealing, try to steal the highest priority thread that is 
</I>&gt;<i> currently
</I>&gt;<i>   waiting by taking priorities into account when finding the target 
</I>&gt;<i> run queue.
</I>&gt;<i> * Simplify stealing code a bit as well.
</I>&gt;<i> * Minor cleanups.

Long story short: with these changes the performance of parallel builds 
improves a lot. The original affine scheduler would scale very badly on 
my quad core. With this it now performs better than the simple 
scheduler. The test case was compiling a kernel with &quot;jam -ajX kernel&quot; 
with different job counts. At first the affine scheduler would take 
more than 5 minutes with a job count of 4. Comparison values with these 
changes:

					j1		j2		j4
scheduler_simple	1:07	0:55	1:05
scheduler_affine	1:03	0:51	1:00

These are jam runs with the jamfiles cached already. There are a few 
things to notice about that. The obvious thing is that the j2 builds 
are quicker than the j4 ones, which indicates that we are scaling very 
badly (as the build times should ideally be half of the corresponding 
lower job count). The other thing to note is CPU usage. With scheduler_
simple, even though the build times are around the same, the CPUs are 
pretty much pegged the whole time. On scheduler_affine however the CPU 
usage is in a more realistic range of using up around 30% of the cores 
distributed relatively evenly. Considering that the build time stays 
more or less constant across the job count, this matches the expected 
CPU usage. I have no real explanation for the pegged CPUs under 
scheduler_simple. Evidently we are scaling very badly in general, but 
at least with the current affine scheduler it is possible to use up the 
idle rest of the CPUs while compiling. I've taken a look at the run 
queues during such a build and they are mostly empty. This means that 
the bottleneck is not the scheduler (as it schedules everything it 
can). The problem seems to be lock contention and IO latency that keep 
the threads from becoming ready in the first place. Further 
investigation is necessary in any case...
