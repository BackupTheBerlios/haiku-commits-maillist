That's not quite correct. There's already a (scheduler-independent) early 
preemption handling when higher-priority threads become ready in two cases:

* release_sem_etc(), if B_DO_NOT_RESCHEDULE is clear.
* thread_block_timeout() (thread.cpp), i.e. timeout on any locking 
primitive.

It would be better to move this special handling to 
scheduler_enqueue_in_run_queue() (also for the simple scheduler), and add a 
flag to this function to avoid immediate unscheduling of the current 
thread. Particularly with multiple CPUs the current method is suboptimal, 
since the woken-up thread might be able to run on another CPU, yet we still 
reschedule the current thread.

It's also a bit tricky to decide in which cases the thread should be 
scheduled immediately. E.g. condition variables are always used in 
conjunction with some other lock (possibly even a spinlock). So scheduling 
a thread immediately in such a case might not be the best decision. At 
least preempting the current thread wouldn't. Scheduling the thread on 
another CPU might often be desirable, given that it takes quite a few 
cycles until the thread actually continues to run -- so the current thread 
would likely already have left the critical section.

CU, Ingo
