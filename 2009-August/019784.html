+version 0.89 [July, 1996]
+  added new initialization API to make libpng work better with shared libs
+     we now have png_create_read_struct(), png_create_write_struct(),
+     png_create_info_struct(), png_destroy_read_struct(), and
+     png_destroy_write_struct() instead of the separate calls to
+     malloc and png_read_init(), png_info_init(), and png_write_init()
+  changed warning/error callback functions to fix bug - this means you
+     should use the new initialization API if you were using the old
+     png_set_message_fn() calls, and that the old API no longer exists
+     so that people are aware that they need to change their code
+  changed filter selection API to allow selection of multiple filters
+     since it didn't work in previous versions of libpng anyways
+  optimized filter selection code
+  fixed png_set_background() to allow using an arbitrary RGB color for
+     paletted images
+  fixed gamma and background correction for paletted images, so
+     png_correct_palette is not needed unless you are correcting an
+     external palette (you will need to #define PNG_CORRECT_PALETTE_SUPPORTED
+     in pngconf.h) - if nobody uses this, it may disappear in the future.
+  fixed bug with Borland 64K memory allocation (Alexander Lehmann)
+  fixed bug in interlace handling (Smarasderagd, I think)
+  added more error checking for writing and image to reduce invalid files
+  separated read and write functions so that they won't both be linked
+     into a binary when only reading or writing functionality is used
+  new pngtest image also has interlacing and zTXt
+  updated documentation to reflect new API
+
+version 0.90 [January, 1997]
+  made CRC errors/warnings on critical and ancillary chunks configurable
+  libpng will use the zlib CRC routines by (compile-time) default
+  changed DOS small/medium model memory support - needs zlib 1.04 (Tim Wegner)
+  added external C++ wrapper statements to png.h (Gilles Dauphin)
+  allow PNG file to be read when some or all of file signature has already
+     been read from the beginning of the stream.  ****This affects the size
+     of info_struct and invalidates all programs that use a shared libpng****
+  fixed png_filler() declarations
+  fixed? background color conversions
+  fixed order of error function pointers to match documentation
+  current chunk name is now available in png_struct to reduce the number
+     of nearly identical error messages (will simplify multi-lingual
+     support when available)
+  try to get ready for unknown-chunk callback functions:
+     - previously read critical chunks are flagged, so the chunk handling
+       routines can determine if the chunk is in the right place
+     - all chunk handling routines have the same prototypes, so we will
+       be able to handle all chunks via a callback mechanism
+  try to fix Linux &quot;setjmp&quot; buffer size problems
+  removed png_large_malloc, png_large_free, and png_realloc functions.
+
+version 0.95 [March, 1997]
+  fixed bug in pngwutil.c allocating &quot;up_row&quot; twice and &quot;avg_row&quot; never
+  fixed bug in PNG file signature compares when start != 0
+  changed parameter type of png_set_filler(...filler...) from png_byte
+     to png_uint_32
+  added test for MACOS to ensure that both math.h and fp.h are not #included
+  added macros for libpng to be compiled as a Windows DLL (Andreas Kupries)
+  added &quot;packswap&quot; transformation, which changes the endianness of
+     packed-pixel bytes (Kevin Bracey)
+  added &quot;strip_alpha&quot; transformation, which removes the alpha channel of
+     input images without using it (not necessarily a good idea)
+  added &quot;swap_alpha&quot; transformation, which puts the alpha channel in front
+     of the color bytes instead of after
+  removed all implicit variable tests which assume NULL == 0 (I think)
+  changed several variables to &quot;png_size_t&quot; to show 16/32-bit limitations
+  added new pCAL chunk read/write support
+  added experimental filter selection weighting (Greg Roelofs)
+  removed old png_set_rgbx() and png_set_xrgb() functions that have been
+     obsolete for about 2 years now (use png_set_filler() instead)
+  added macros to read 16- and 32-bit ints directly from buffer, to be
+     used only on those systems that support it (namely PowerPC and 680x0)
+     With some testing, this may become the default for MACOS/PPC systems.
+  only calculate CRC on data if we are going to use it
+  added macros for zTXt compression type PNG_zTXt_COMPRESSION_???
+  added macros for simple libpng debugging output selectable at compile time
+  removed PNG_READ_END_MODE in progressive reader (Smarasderagd)
+  more description of info_struct in libpng.txt and png.h
+  more instructions in example.c
+  more chunk types tested in pngtest.c
+  renamed pngrcb.c to pngset.c, and all png_read_&lt;chunk&gt; functions to be
+     png_set_&lt;chunk&gt;.  We now have corresponding png_get_&lt;chunk&gt;
+     functions in pngget.c to get information in info_ptr.  This isolates
+     the application from the internal organization of png_info_struct
+     (good for shared library implementations).

+     black pixels to background when a background is supplied and
+     no pixels are transparent
+  repaired PNG_NO_STDIO behaviour
+  tested NODIV support and made it default behaviour (Greg Roelofs)
+  added &quot;-m&quot; option and PNGTEST_DEBUG_MEMORY to pngtest (John Bowler)
+  regularized version numbering scheme and bumped shared-library major
+     version number to 2 to avoid problems with libpng 0.89 apps (Greg Roelofs)

+  fixed a longstanding &quot;packswap&quot; bug in pngtrans.c
+  fixed some inconsistencies in pngconf.h that prevented compiling with
+     PNG_READ_GAMMA_SUPPORTED and PNG_READ_hIST_SUPPORTED undefined
+  fixed some typos and made other minor rearrangement of libpng.txt (Andreas)
+  changed recommendation about file_gamma for PC images to .50 from .51 in

+  Created separate write_end_info_struct in pngtest.c for a more severe test.
+  Added code in pngwrite.c to free info_ptr-&gt;text[i].key to stop a memory leak.

+  Add type cast (png_const_charp) two places in png.c
+  Eliminated pngtypes.h; use macros instead to declare PNG_CHNK arrays.
+  Renamed &quot;PNG_GLOBAL_ARRAYS&quot; to &quot;PNG_USE_GLOBAL_ARRAYS&quot; and made available
+    to applications a macro &quot;PNG_USE_LOCAL_ARRAYS&quot;.
+  Remove all the new declarations with #ifdef/#endif when
+    PNG_USE_GLOBAL_ARRAYS is defined.
+  Added PNG_EXPORT_VAR macro to accommodate making DLL's.
+version 1.0.5e [November 30, 1999]
+  Added iCCP, iTXt, and sPLT support; added &quot;lang&quot; member to the png_text
+    structure; refactored the inflate/deflate support to make adding new chunks
+    with trailing compressed parts easier in the future, and added new functions
+    png_free_iCCP, png_free_pCAL, png_free_sPLT, png_free_text, png_get_iCCP,
+    png_get_spalettes, png_set_iCCP, png_set_spalettes (Eric S. Raymond).
+  NOTE: Applications that write text chunks MUST define png_text-&gt;lang
+    before calling png_set_text(). It must be set to NULL if you want to
+    write tEXt or zTXt chunks.  If you want your application to be able to
+    run with older versions of libpng, use
+
+      #ifdef PNG_iTXt_SUPPORTED
+         png_text[i].lang = NULL;
+      #endif
+
+  Changed png_get_oFFs() and png_set_oFFs() to use signed rather than unsigned
+    offsets (Eric S. Raymond).
+  Combined PNG_READ_cHNK_SUPPORTED and PNG_WRITE_cHNK_SUPPORTED macros into
+    PNG_cHNK_SUPPORTED and combined the three types of PNG_text_SUPPORTED
+    macros, leaving the separate macros also available.
+  Removed comments on #endifs at the end of many short, non-nested #if-blocks.
+version 1.0.5f [December 6, 1999]
+  Changed makefile.solaris to issue a warning about potential problems when
+    the ucb &quot;ld&quot; is in the path ahead of the ccs &quot;ld&quot;.
+  Removed &quot;- [date]&quot; from the &quot;synopsis&quot; line in libpng.3 and libpngpf.3.
+  Added sCAL chunk support (Eric S. Raymond).
+version 1.0.5g [December 7, 1999]
+  Fixed &quot;png_free_spallettes&quot; typo in png.h
+  Added code to handle new chunks in pngpread.c
+  Moved PNG_CHNK string macro definitions outside of PNG_NO_EXTERN block
+  Added &quot;translated_key&quot; to png_text structure and png_write_iTXt().
+  Added code in pngwrite.c to work around a newly discovered zlib bug.
+version 1.0.5h [December 10, 1999]
+  NOTE: regarding the note for version 1.0.5e, the following must also
+    be included in your code:
+        png_text[i].translated_key = NULL;
+  Unknown chunk handling is now supported.

+  Added some parameters to the new png_set_keep_unknown_chunks() function.
+  Added a test for up-&gt;location != 0 in the first instance of writing
+    unknown chunks in pngwrite.c
+  Changed &quot;num&quot; to &quot;i&quot; in png_free_spalettes() and png_free_unknowns() to
+    prevent recursion.
+  Added png_free_hIST() function.
+  Various patches to fix bugs in the sCAL and integer cHRM processing,
+    and to add some convenience macros for use with sCAL.
+version 1.0.5j [December 21, 1999]
+  Changed &quot;unit&quot; parameter of png_write_sCAL from png_byte to int, to work
+    around buggy compilers.
+  Added new type &quot;png_fixed_point&quot; for integers that hold float*100000 values
+  Restored backward compatibility of tEXt/zTXt chunk processing:
+    Restored the first four members of png_text to the same order as v.1.0.5d.
+    Added members &quot;lang_key&quot; and &quot;itxt_length&quot; to png_text struct.  Set
+    text_length=0 when &quot;text&quot; contains iTXt data.  Use the &quot;compression&quot;
+    member to distinguish among tEXt/zTXt/iTXt types.  Added
+    PNG_ITXT_COMPRESSION_NONE (1) and PNG_ITXT_COMPRESSION_zTXt(2) macros.
+    The &quot;Note&quot; above, about backward incompatibility of libpng-1.0.5e, no
+    longer applies.
+  Fixed png_read|write_iTXt() to read|write parameters in the right order,
+    and to write the iTXt chunk after IDAT if it appears in the end_ptr.
+  Added pnggccrd.c, version of pngvcrd.c Intel assembler for gcc (Greg Roelofs)
+  Reversed the order of trying to write floating-point and fixed-point gAMA.
+version 1.0.5k [December 27, 1999]
+  Added many parentheses, e.g., &quot;if (a &amp;&amp; b &amp; c)&quot; becomes &quot;if (a &amp;&amp; (b &amp; c))&quot;
+  Added png_handle_as_unknown() function (Glenn)
+  Added png_free_chunk_list() function and chunk_list and num_chunk_list members
+    of png_ptr.
+  Eliminated erroneous warnings about multiple sPLT chunks and sPLT-after-PLTE.
+  Fixed a libpng-1.0.5h bug in pngrutil.c that was issuing erroneous warnings
+    about ignoring incorrect gAMA with sRGB (gAMA was in fact not ignored)
+  Added png_free_tRNS(); png_set_tRNS() now malloc's its own trans array (ESR).
+  Define png_get_int_32 when oFFs chunk is supported as well as when pCAL is.
+  Changed type of proflen from png_int_32 to png_uint_32 in png_get_iCCP().
+version 1.0.5l [January 1, 2000]
+  Added functions png_set_read_user_chunk_fn() and png_get_user_chunk_ptr()
+    for setting a callback function to handle unknown chunks and for
+    retrieving the associated user pointer (Glenn).
+version 1.0.5m [January 7, 2000]
+  Added high-level functions png_read_png(), png_write_png(), png_free_pixels().
+version 1.0.5n [January 9, 2000]
+  Added png_free_PLTE() function, and modified png_set_PLTE() to malloc its
+    own memory for info_ptr-&gt;palette.  This makes it safe for the calling
+    application to free its copy of the palette any time after it calls
+    png_set_PLTE().
+version 1.0.5o [January 20, 2000]
+  Cosmetic changes only (removed some trailing blanks and TABs)
+version 1.0.5p [January 31, 2000]
+  Renamed pngdll.mak to makefile.bd32
+  Cosmetic changes in pngtest.c

+  Revised makefile.gcmmx
+  Added PNG_SETJMP_SUPPORTED, PNG_SETJMP_NOT_SUPPORTED, and PNG_ABORT() macros
+version 1.0.5r [February 7, 2000]
+  Removed superfluous prototype for png_get_itxt from png.h
+  Fixed a bug in pngrtran.c that improperly expanded the background color.
+  Return *num_text=0 from png_get_text() when appropriate, and fix documentation
+    of png_get_text() in libpng.txt/libpng.3.
+version 1.0.5s [February 18, 2000]
+  Added &quot;png_jmp_env()&quot; macro to pngconf.h, to help people migrate to the
+    new error handler that's planned for the next libpng release, and changed
+    example.c, pngtest.c, and contrib programs to use this macro.
+  Revised some of the DLL-export macros in pngconf.h (Greg Roelofs)
+  Fixed a bug in png_read_png() that caused it to fail to expand some images
+    that it should have expanded.
+  Fixed some mistakes in the unused and undocumented INCH_CONVERSIONS functions
+    in pngget.c
+  Changed the allocation of palette, history, and trans arrays back to
+    the version 1.0.5 method (linking instead of copying) which restores
+    backward compatibility with version 1.0.5.  Added some remarks about
+    that in example.c.  Added &quot;free_me&quot; member to info_ptr and png_ptr
+    and added png_free_data() function.
+  Updated makefile.linux and makefile.gccmmx to make directories conditionally.
+  Made cosmetic changes to pngasmrd.h
+  Added png_set_rows() and png_get_rows(), for use with png_read|write_png().

+    hasn't already been allocated.
+version 1.0.5t [March 4, 2000]
+  Changed png_jmp_env() migration aiding macro to png_jmpbuf().
+  Fixed &quot;interlace&quot; typo (should be &quot;interlaced&quot;) in contrib/gregbook/read2-x.c

+    PNG_FLAG_HAVE_CHUNK_HEADER was moved into png_ptr-&gt;mode in version 1.0.5b
+  Files in contrib/gregbook were revised to use png_jmpbuf() and to select
+    a 24-bit visual if one is available, and to allow abbreviated options.
+  Files in contrib/pngminus were revised to use the png_jmpbuf() macro.
+  Removed spaces in makefile.linux and makefile.gcmmx, introduced in 1.0.5s
+version 1.0.5u [March 5, 2000]
+  Simplified the code that detects old png.h in png.c and pngtest.c
+  Renamed png_spalette (_p, _pp) to png_sPLT_t (_tp, _tpp)
+  Increased precision of rgb_to_gray calculations from 8 to 15 bits and
+    added png_set_rgb_to_gray_fixed() function.
+  Added makefile.bc32 (32-bit Borland C++, C mode)
+version 1.0.5v [March 11, 2000]
+  Added some parentheses to the png_jmpbuf macro definition.
+  Updated references to the zlib home page, which has moved to freesoftware.com.
+  Corrected bugs in documentation regarding png_read_row() and png_write_row().
+  Updated documentation of png_rgb_to_gray calculations in libpng.3/libpng.txt.

+    revised borland makefiles; added makefile.ibmvac3 and makefile.gcc (Cosmin)
+

+  Minor revisions of makefile.bor, libpng.txt, and gregbook/rpng2-win.c
+  Added makefile.sggcc (SGI IRIX with gcc)
+version 1.0.6d [April 7, 2000]
+  Changed sprintf() to strcpy() in png_write_sCAL_s() to work without STDIO
+  Added data_length parameter to png_decompress_chunk() function
+  Revised documentation to remove reference to abandoned png_free_chnk functions
+  Fixed an error in png_rgb_to_gray_fixed()
+  Revised example.c, usage of png_destroy_write_struct().
+  Renamed makefile.ibmvac3 to makefile.ibmc, added libpng.icc IBM project file
+  Added a check for info_ptr-&gt;free_me&amp;PNG_FREE_TEXT when freeing text in png.c
+  Simplify png_sig_bytes() function to remove use of non-ISO-C strdup().
+version 1.0.6e [April 9, 2000]
+  Added png_data_freer() function.
+  In the code that checks for over-length tRNS chunks, added check of
+    info_ptr-&gt;num_trans as well as png_ptr-&gt;num_trans (Matthias Benckmann)
+  Minor revisions of libpng.txt/libpng.3.
+  Check for existing data and free it if the free_me flag is set, in png_set_*()
+    and png_handle_*().
+  Only define PNG_WEIGHTED_FILTERS_SUPPORTED when PNG_FLOATING_POINT_SUPPORTED
+    is defined.
+  Changed several instances of PNG_NO_CONSOLE_ID to PNG_NO_STDIO in pngrutil.c
+    and mentioned the purposes of the two macros in libpng.txt/libpng.3.
+version 1.0.6f [April 14, 2000]
+  Revised png_set_iCCP() and png_set_rows() to avoid prematurely freeing data.
+  Add checks in png_set_text() for NULL members of the input text structure.
+  Revised libpng.txt/libpng.3.
+  Removed superfluous prototype for png_set_itxt from png.h
+  Removed &quot;else&quot; from pngread.c, after png_error(), and changed &quot;0&quot; to &quot;length&quot;.
+  Changed several png_errors about malformed ancillary chunks to png_warnings.
+version 1.0.6g [April 24, 2000]
+  Added png_pass-* arrays to pnggccrd.c when PNG_USE_LOCAL_ARRAYS is defined.
+  Relocated paragraph about png_set_background() in libpng.3/libpng.txt
+    and other revisions (Matthias Benckmann)
+  Relocated info_ptr-&gt;free_me, png_ptr-&gt;free_me, and other info_ptr and
+    png_ptr members to restore binary compatibility with libpng-1.0.5
+    (breaks compatibility with libpng-1.0.6).
+version 1.0.6h [April 24, 2000]
+  Changed shared library so-number pattern from 2.x.y.z to xy.z (this builds
+    libpng.so.10 &amp; libpng.so.10.6h instead of libpng.so.2 &amp; libpng.so.2.1.0.6h)
+    This is a temporary change for test purposes.
+version 1.0.6i [May 2, 2000]
+  Rearranged some members at the end of png_info and png_struct, to put
+    unknown_chunks_num and free_me within the original size of the png_structs
+    and free_me, png_read_user_fn, and png_free_fn within the original png_info,
+    because some old applications allocate the structs directly instead of
+    using png_create_*().
+  Added documentation of user memory functions in libpng.txt/libpng.3
+  Modified png_read_png so that it will use user_allocated row_pointers
+    if present, unless free_me directs that it be freed, and added description
+    of the use of png_set_rows() and png_get_rows() in libpng.txt/libpng.3.
+  Added PNG_LEGACY_SUPPORTED macro, and #ifdef out all new (since version
+    1.00) members of png_struct and png_info, to regain binary compatibility
+    when you define this macro.  Capabilities lost in this event
+    are user transforms (new in version 1.0.0),the user transform pointer
+    (new in version 1.0.2), rgb_to_gray (new in 1.0.5), iCCP, sCAL, sPLT,
+    the high-level interface, and unknown chunks support (all new in 1.0.6).
+    This was necessary because of old applications that allocate the structs
+    directly as authors were instructed to do in libpng-0.88 and earlier,
+    instead of using png_create_*().
+  Added modes PNG_CREATED_READ_STRUCT and PNG_CREATED_WRITE_STRUCT which
+    can be used to detect codes that directly allocate the structs, and
+    code to check these modes in png_read_init() and png_write_init() and
+    generate a libpng error if the modes aren't set and PNG_LEGACY_SUPPORTED
+    was not defined.
+  Added makefile.intel and updated makefile.watcom (Pawel Mrochen)
+version 1.0.6j [May 3, 2000]
+  Overloaded png_read_init() and png_write_init() with macros that convert
+    calls to png_read_init_2() or png_write_init_2() that check the version
+    and structure sizes.
+version 1.0.7beta11 [May 7, 2000]
+  Removed the new PNG_CREATED_READ_STRUCT and PNG_CREATED_WRITE_STRUCT modes
+    which are no longer used.
+  Eliminated the three new members of png_text when PNG_LEGACY_SUPPORTED is
+    defined or when neither PNG_READ_iTXt_SUPPORTED nor PNG_WRITE_iTXT_SUPPORTED
+    is defined.
+  Made PNG_NO_READ|WRITE_iTXt the default setting, to avoid memory
+    overrun when old applications fill the info_ptr-&gt;text structure directly.
+  Added PNGAPI macro, and added it to the definitions of all exported functions.
+  Relocated version macro definitions ahead of the includes of zlib.h and
+    pngconf.h in png.h.
+version 1.0.7beta12 [May 12, 2000]
+  Revised pngset.c to avoid a problem with expanding the png_debug macro.
+  Deleted some extraneous defines from pngconf.h
+  Made PNG_NO_CONSOLE_IO the default condition when PNG_BUILD_DLL is defined.
+  Use MSC _RPTn debugging instead of fprintf if _MSC_VER is defined.
+  Added png_access_version_number() function.
+  Check for mask&amp;PNG_FREE_CHNK (for TEXT, SCAL, PCAL) in png_free_data().
+  Expanded libpng.3/libpng.txt information about png_data_freer().
+version 1.0.7beta14 [May 17, 2000] (beta13 was not published)
+  Changed pnggccrd.c and pngvcrd.c to handle bad adaptive filter types as
+    warnings instead of errors, as pngrutil.c does.
+  Set the PNG_INFO_IDAT valid flag in png_set_rows() so png_write_png()
+    will actually write IDATs.
+  Made the default PNG_USE_LOCAL_ARRAYS depend on PNG_DLL instead of WIN32.
+  Make png_free_data() ignore its final parameter except when freeing data
+    that can have multiple instances (text, sPLT, unknowns).
+  Fixed a new bug in png_set_rows().
+  Removed info_ptr-&gt;valid tests from png_free_data(), as in version 1.0.5.
+  Added png_set_invalid() function.
+  Fixed incorrect illustrations of png_destroy_write_struct() in example.c.
+version 1.0.7beta15 [May 30, 2000]
+  Revised the deliberately erroneous Linux setjmp code in pngconf.h to produce
+    fewer error messages.
+  Rearranged checks for Z_OK to check the most likely path first in pngpread.c
+    and pngwutil.c.
+  Added checks in pngtest.c for png_create_*() returning NULL, and mentioned
+    in libpng.txt/libpng.3 the need for applications to check this.
+  Changed names of png_default_*() functions in pngtest to pngtest_*().
+  Changed return type of png_get_x|y_offset_*() from png_uint_32 to png_int_32.
+  Fixed some bugs in the unused PNG_INCH_CONVERSIONS functions in pngget.c
+  Set each pointer to NULL after freeing it in png_free_data().
+  Worked around a problem in pngconf.h; AIX's strings.h defines an &quot;index&quot;
+    macro that conflicts with libpng's png_color_16.index. (Dimitri Papadapoulos)
+  Added &quot;msvc&quot; directory with MSVC++ project files (Simon-Pierre Cadieux).
+version 1.0.7beta16 [June 4, 2000]
+  Revised the workaround of AIX string.h &quot;index&quot; bug.
+  Added a check for overlength PLTE chunk in pngrutil.c.
+  Added PNG_NO_POINTER_INDEXING macro to use array-indexing instead of pointer
+    indexing in pngrutil.c and pngwutil.c to accommodate a buggy compiler.
+  Added a warning in png_decompress_chunk() when it runs out of data, e.g.
+    when it tries to read an erroneous PhotoShop iCCP chunk.
+  Added PNG_USE_DLL macro.
+  Revised the copyright/disclaimer/license notice.
+  Added contrib/msvctest directory
+version 1.0.7rc1 [June 9, 2000]
+  Corrected the definition of PNG_TRANSFORM_INVERT_ALPHA  (0x0400 not 0x0200)
+  Added contrib/visupng directory (Willem van Schaik)
+version 1.0.7beta18 [June 23, 2000]
+  Revised PNGAPI definition, and pngvcrd.c to work with __GCC__
+    and do not redefine PNGAPI if it is passed in via a compiler directive.
+  Revised visupng/PngFile.c to remove returns from within the Try block.
+  Removed leading underscores from &quot;_PNG_H&quot; and &quot;_PNG_SAVE_BSD_SOURCE&quot; macros.
+  Updated contrib/visupng/cexcept.h to version 1.0.0.
+  Fixed bugs in pngwrite.c and pngwutil.c that prevented writing iCCP chunks.
+version 1.0.7rc2 [June 28, 2000]
+  Updated license to include disclaimers required by UCITA.
+  Fixed &quot;DJBPP&quot; typo in pnggccrd.c introduced in beta18.
+
+version 1.0.7 [July 1, 2000]
+  Revised the definition of &quot;trans_values&quot; in libpng.3/libpng.txt
+version 1.0.8beta1 [July 8, 2000]
+  Added png_free(png_ptr, key) two places in pngpread.c to stop memory leaks.
+  Changed PNG_NO_STDIO to PNG_NO_CONSOLE_IO, several places in pngrutil.c and
+     pngwutil.c.
+  Changed PNG_EXPORT_VAR to use PNG_IMPEXP, in pngconf.h.
+  Removed unused &quot;#include &lt;assert.h&gt;&quot; from png.c
+  Added WindowsCE support.
+  Revised pnggccrd.c to work with gcc-2.95.2 and in the Cygwin environment.
+version 1.0.8beta2 [July 10, 2000]
+  Added project files to the wince directory and made further revisions
+     of pngtest.c, pngrio.c, and pngwio.c in support of WindowsCE.
