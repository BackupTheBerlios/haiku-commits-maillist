&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Also, when exiting (ALT+Q), all colors in the Desktop

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That doesn't happen here, though. Neither on qemu nor on 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; VirtualBox,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; where I just tried a clean installation and a fresh checkout.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> BTW, I just managed to reproduce this once in 20 runs. To do that, I
</I>&gt;<i> had to launch ParticlesII and then quit it immediately before it
</I>&gt;<i> showed the screen.
</I>&gt;<i> Moreover, this caused (once) the problem described in ticket #2658.
</I>&gt;<i> I suspect some race condition in app_server.
</I>
And that could be triggered more easily in my machine as I have 4 
processors. I guess you are in the correct track. Also, I am pretty 
sure the reason the problem in #2658 is because, somehow, the app_server 
still thinks the resolution is the old one. In my case, I see this not 
by the fact that the Deskbar is in the wrong place (as it is not) but 
by the fact that the only region that is invalidated just after I leave 
full screen mode is the the one with the same size the scrren was in 
full screen, starting in the top-left corner.

in fact, I am pretty sure you can also see this invalidation problem 
with BDirectWindow. Start that Stars demo. Move the window so it is 
more to the top-left corner of the screen. Switch if to full screen 
mode (ALT+F) and then back to windowed mode (ALT+F again). You will 
notice that a region of the screen to the right and bellow the center 
shows some black dots where some stars were. That region of the screen 
was not invalidated when fullscreen mode was exited.
