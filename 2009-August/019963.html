</I>
That makes sense; GLTeapod actually hung while getting the screen_id 
for a window (which didn't need a lock before).
I definitely didn't see the impact of problems that this simple change 
caused (getting rid of Desktop::ActiveScreen())...

Any other app_server communication that needs the window lock would be 
troublesome as well, though, but I don't think there is a good solution 
for this. So I will probably let Window remember its screen ID, so that 
it doesn't need to lock the Desktop anymore.

&gt;<i> &gt; Looked into GLTeapod, and understood at least that particular 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; problem:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the app_server waits for the direct window while having the window 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; lock
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; write locked.0
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This causes a dead lock, as BGLView tries to perform some 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; app_server
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; commands while having a lock held that the direct connect hook 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; needs as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; well.
</I>&gt;<i> Well, that could be also the same problem of Chart, then.
</I>
Let's see :-)

&gt;<i> &gt; Also, the direct windows are stopped too late on screen change, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; causing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the occasional crash while the frame buffer was not accessible this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; way. That was probably the cause why ParticlesII often crashed on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; workspace switch.
</I>&gt;<i> I couldn't reproduce that one, though.
</I>
It happened quite often here in VESA mode (as this one unmaps its 
memory during mode changes), although real graphics cards would be more 
troublesome (as their frame buffer could hold any kind of data 
important for the graphics chip).

&gt;<i> &gt; I'm currently reworking the code in the app_server, but I stumbled 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; upon
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; something that I don't understand how it's supposed to work: what 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; stops
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; direct windows if I move another window on top of it? Who is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; responsible for that?
</I>&gt;<i> It's done in Window::SetClipping(). There HandleDirectConnection() is
</I>&gt;<i> called with B_DIRECT_MODIFY | B_CLIPPING_CHANGED.
</I>
Thanks, that makes sense!

Bye,
   Axel.
