Hi,
 
 ...
&gt;<i> Correct me if I am wrong, but what I gather from your long email is 
</I>&gt;<i> that:
</I>
I apologize before-hand for finding it hard to answer in
a short, simple way.

&gt;<i> 1) People files suck, so we should drop them in
</I>&gt;<i> favor of a non-attributed file format.
</I>
We should give them content in -addition- to attributes.

(So we can share them with friends who don't run Haiku - 
without relying on a special tool, system- or web service.)

We gain better interoperability and loose nothing.
 
&gt;<i> 2) Solid in-file data formats are preferred over attributes.
</I>
It depends on the purpose of the data format. If a data format
has any ambitions beyond Haiku it would not make itself truly 
-depend- on attributes. 

For an image, document or audio format I created and wanted
everyone to use, I'd make it a file with embedded metadata
(like mp3 or jpeg) which could be exported to attributes if
one wanted to. My application would probably do so, export
some metadata, and also make hidden use of attributes to
store temporary things like cursor position in a document
or zoom level in an image, but it would not fail to use 
the -data- simply because some attribute is missing.
It would merely loose the zoom level or cursor position.
Degrading gracefully. (BeOS email does that. StyledEdit
files do it. People files and Net+ bookmarks do not.
That's what I consider less smart about them.)

For private data, like storing my application settings,
I'd prefer a flattened BMessage (in a file) over storing
my settings as individual attributes on a file, simply
because its less code to do so.

There's a whole spectrum between these opposites of public 
file formats meant to be shared and gain support among 
apps and platforms ones that are essentially tied to one
application on one platform, and perhaps not even meant
for human consumption.

&gt;<i> 3) We should not duplicate in-file data with equivalent data in 
</I>&gt;<i> attributes.
</I>
How did you deduce that from what I've written?

I think its great to duplicate data in attributes when it 
makes sense to present, organize and search that data using
attributes. It's an excellent way to label and find data.

But it depends on the kind of data and how it's meant to
be used. Most of the files present on a Haiku system we
don't provide content-specific attributes for beyond type
because it wouldn't make sense to do so - there might be
no meaningful metadata to export or there might be little
interest in it.

&gt;<i> Excuse me, but would that not make attribute-based queries
</I>&gt;<i> irrelevant in the end? In fact, I see a contradiction in
</I>&gt;<i> terms between you saying that you love BFS/queries and the
</I>&gt;<i> direction that you seem to want to take Haiku to.
</I>
Wanting a few Haiku file types to be given file content
so they can be meaningfully shared with others, and/or
degrade gracefully if the worst happens, does not contradict
loving attributes or fly in the face of the Be way.
 
&gt;<i> With regards to your suggestion that ZIP files addresses the exchange 
</I>&gt;<i> of 
</I>&gt;<i> attributed data, I think that's neither very convenient nor nice 
</I>&gt;<i> coming 
</I>&gt;<i> from a personal computing OS that claims to be focused on the end 
</I>&gt;<i> user 
</I>&gt;<i> experience.
</I>
On a very basic level zip does adress the exchange of 
attributed data - when used - as most of the attributes
you would otherwise lose are either only meaningful in a
BeOS context (and all of us do zip) or data that is also
part of the file or could easily be recreated by a user
of some other system.

I'm not saying I like it. I'm open to other ideas.

Addressing exchange of attributed data on a higher level
would probably entail looking at how to translate specific
file formats to other well-understood formats. E.g. when
attaching files to an email. Not because our formats suck
but because other platforms might not understand them.

Anyhow, what I write is not a message from Haiku, or even
my own mission statement. It's a temporary expression of
my views and sentiments. And I'm just one guy.

/Jonas.
