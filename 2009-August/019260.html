Next: Alt-Down, Right, Down. Previous: Alt-Up, Left, Up, Backspace.

I also had some thoughts of making Page Up move 5 images back and Page
Down move 5 images forward. This could help speed up looking through
images for something.

&gt;<i> For one thing: Could we put the whole Page-browsing under the submenu &quot;Browse|Go to Page&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> ? This is only applicable for TIFF (IIRC) that have more than one page within one file.
</I>&gt;<i> It's so seldomly needed (I guess) that we should really hide it away a bit.
</I>
Yeah those 99% unused menu items have always sort of annoyed me. I
didn't even know what they were for a while.

&gt;<i> &#160;&gt; Now there is no way to scroll with the keyboard.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think it was suggested to have SHIFT+cursor do the moving.
</I>
I actually misread that as SHIFT+(the mouse cursor) for some reason
but I had the thought of doing that. I'll add it in.

&gt;<i> Quickly implement a toolbar then... :)
</I>
I did have a thought of floating buttons on the left and right, at
least in fullscreen mode.

&gt;<i> Because that's already taken by &quot;Browse|Go to Page|1&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> I wanted to suggest ALT+0 for &quot;Original Size&quot; anyway. It's done with that in various other
</I>&gt;<i> apps, e.g. Firefox.
</I>
Ah, I didn't remember that shortcut because I just never look at that
stuff. I got the idea for Alt-1 from Gnome's image viewer (which
actually uses just 1.) For now Alt-0 will work.
