It is largely adressed by zip. Attributes don't matter
to the other platforms. They don't get them, but they
don't miss them either.

Exchanging files with content (of the kinds people out
there generally care about: jpgs, mp3, pdfs, word, ...)
is not problem. Not between ourselves and not with
the rest of the world.

Exchanging attribut-centric files like People files with
the rest of the world is not meaningful. Their software
does not understand attributes but expect a single
data stream. This is not likely to change. Even if they
did understand attributes, the People fileformat would
still be a format no apps out there care about. It's a
fringe format.

I'm not saying we should hide attributes, or stop using
them. (I love attributes, okay?) We use attributes as 
much as we like, when they make sense, when their properties
allow us to solve a problem better with them than without
them. We can make attributes available e.g. via ftp, or
with email attachments, but we can't force them on anyone.

 ...
&gt;<i> &gt; IMO, any content that is part of a file (embedded)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; should have authority over attributes. Attributes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; are just a cache, IMO. Here I'm thinking primarily
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; about document and content type of files, like 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Word documents, jpegs and mp3s - things meant to be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; shared - and not so much about local phenomenon such
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; as application settings, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; People files are stupid, IMO, since they're a type
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of file you're likely to want to exchange with non-
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; BeOS/Haiku people and over non-BeOS/Haiku media
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and transport. I love the attributes but I think
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; its madness not giving them any content that other
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; systems might understand.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The indexed attributes are the soul of Haiku and its
</I>&gt;<i> file system;
</I>
I'm not disputing that. Attributes have some great properties.
But, like files, they're just a filesystem feature, granted
a very useful one. But files are more robust and interoperable
than attributes. Content is king.

&gt;<i> by saying what you are saying, in a way you are
</I>&gt;<i> negating one of the (strong IMO) selling points
</I>&gt;<i> of Haiku. Relegating BFS attributes to second class 
</I>&gt;<i> citizenship as you suggest not only would you make 
</I>&gt;<i> Haiku less unique and interesting, but you open the
</I>&gt;<i> door to making that selling point less compelling,
</I>&gt;<i> probably even irrelevant over time.
</I>
I don't understand what it is you think I'm saying.

Clearly for mp3/id3 and jpeg/exif, the attributes
are a secondary non-authoritative form of the same
data. I don't see how that makes attributes any less
great.

What I want is robust file formats used by Haiku 
applications, so I can worry less when moving them
across non-Haiku services and media. Which I know
I will.

I don't want to build and maintain a &quot;babel-fish&quot;
just so Windows software, websites and the general
public can understand People files.

I think you're grossly overexaggerating my means to
make Haiku less compelling. Haiku continues to have
all its great features and we will maximize our use
of them when it makes sense to do so, while also
trying to increase interoperability.

Hopefully in the end you and I both get what we want.

/Jonas.
