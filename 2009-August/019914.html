I actually find them quite common still on ATX motherboards I buy,
they seem to be rare mostly on laptop computers and smaller form
factor machines these days.

Would be nice if the boot menu had a serial debug option ;)

&gt;<i> * When you run into some random KDL and want to capture the stack trace, you

</I>
Yes, there are times when I've attached the serial cable *after* a KDL
to get the info, so I agree.

&gt;&gt;<i> For everyone else, active serial debugging seriously degrades the first
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> impression (like because of audio skipping, which we cannot afford at all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> IMHO), which defeats a lot of the purpose of the alpha (to give a good

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OK, I wasn't aware that the serial debugging was the cause of the audio
</I>&gt;<i> skipping. I wonder why, since at least normally there should be very little

</I>
Perhaps we had some extremely chatty audio drivers?

Also, serial debug does seem to increase boot times by a couple
seconds (my own experience)... not that this is terribly noticeable
for most people, but it can be as much as 15-20% of the boot time ;)

Perhaps we could just leave it enabled in the nightly builds (from
trunk) and steer people to those in the event that they have an issue
at boot?
