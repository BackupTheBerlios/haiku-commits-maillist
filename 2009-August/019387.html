That seems to be the wrong reason for making a change like this.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> and we have to interface with

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Keep in mind, we're talking about screenshots here... not every file

</I>&gt;<i> purpose of screenshots IMO.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
There is no way to draw the line IMO. Doing this here sets the precedent 
for eventually doing this for all other files types; once you open the 
floodgates, that's what's going to happen. People will then say: oh, 
this is necessary because mp3 players need it, or because other OSes 
don't &lt;insert other OS braindeadness of choice here&gt;, etc. Before you 
know it, Haiku will have inherited the braindeadness of other OSes, 
making the whole argument that we don't need file extensions because we 
make intelligent use of mime types a moot point.

&gt;&gt;<i> The &quot;Windows is so dumb that needs extensions to know the file type&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> joke has always been a classic in the BeOS/Haiku scene, and now we make
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Haiku behave the same way, unnecessarily and for the wrong reasons.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not just windows, but every browser that has to show a screenshot
</I>&gt;<i> where the server doesn't provide the mime type...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also half a dozen other OSes that also have no mime-sniffing magic in them.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
My question to this is: is Haiku aiming to become a better OS, or is it 
going to aim for a minimal common denominator in the name of 
interoperability?

&gt;<i> We can't change the world by ignoring it.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
You are suggesting to be pragmatic and simply go with the status quo, 
but Haiku has never been about going with the status quo. Had we been 
pragmatic (as opposed to idealistic) as you suggest from the very 
beginning, Haiku would have not been started in the first place.

FWIW and IMVHO. Cheers,

Jorge
