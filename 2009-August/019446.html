</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Exchanging attribut-centric files like People files with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the rest of the world is not meaningful. Their software
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; does not understand attributes but expect a single
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; data stream. This is not likely to change. Even if they
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; did understand attributes, the People fileformat would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; still be a format no apps out there care about. It's a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; fringe format.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe. One idea I've had for a while is to build a simple system to
</I>&gt;<i> sync People files with various online contact systems. My priority
</I>&gt;<i> would be Google Contacts. This could serve as a middle-man for
</I>&gt;<i> contacts between various operating systems.
</I>
A good idea.

&gt;<i> Another option is to make the actual People files content vCard 
</I>&gt;<i> files.
</I>&gt;<i> The vCard format is quite simple and pretty well accepted on various
</I>&gt;<i> systems, AFAIK. Since People files would otherwise be empty this 
</I>&gt;<i> would
</I>&gt;<i> also be fairly backwards compatible. The only problem is having the
</I>&gt;<i> same data in two places (inside the file and the attributes) which is
</I>&gt;<i> redundant and requires updating two places when they are modified. Of
</I>&gt;<i> course we already have this for mp3 and other formats so maybe it
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't matter.
</I>
Yes, I've always thought that this would be a good idea.
And that the People application should look for inconsistency
between file content and attributes on opening the file
and ask the user what to do about it. So if you edited the
attributes in Tracker and then opened the file, People
would tell you about it and ask you what data to keep.

(The alternative  from my point-of view would be to disallow
people to edit the attributes, making them read-only, but 
that's not nice to people who liked editing them in Tracker.)

The two-way solution works as long as People is the only
or at least the primary editor of the people files. If one
throws an AltPeople into the mix that does not care about
inconsistencies between the vCard and the attributes, 
it breaks down. (This AltPeople app might be used by some
other Haiku user who received your file, in which case you
couldn't do much about the inconsistent data you sent them.
Or it might be a Linux user who might see only the vCard
and not the more recently edited attribute data.)

It might of course be possible to make an add-on based file
content/attribute sync daemon, perhaps a second personality
for the indexing server, and this might improve the user
experience. I'm not opposed to such a thing. But how does
one find out that a file is not in use, having been changed
recently? (So it can safely have its file contents or 
attributes synced.) Is there an fstat to enumerate open files?

&gt;<i> Since People files seem to be your primary concern,
</I>&gt;<i> either of the above seems like a reasonable option.
</I>
Reasonable indeed. I want both! :)

Shareable fileformats, smarter applications, a local
content-syncing daemon and webservices integration.
That's a whole lot of goodies.

But, man, I need to work on my communication skills.
I assure you that I have given some thought to 
attribute and file content beyond People files.
I've lived with attributed files since R3.

/Jonas.
