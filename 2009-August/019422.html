Thank you for seeing beyond the temptation of taking the easy way out. :)

</I>
Since Haiku is by definition about sane defaults and minimal 
configuration, I would also prefer not going overboard with 
configuration options every time a situation like this arises. I think 
we need to step back and try to Be creative.

&gt;<i> Maybe an add-on AddExtention - Alt+Opt+X would suffice. Invoked on a folder it would work

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe, this could be thought even further as a kind of Prepare-4-Export that would also do 
</I>&gt;<i> a Attributes2Tags where applicable.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
Now, that's more like it. :) Perhaps Something like this and/or (and I 
know this may be ambitious) a mechanism that uses Haiku's overlay file 
system to gracefully handle moving files from/to non-BFS partitions, by 
adding file extensions in one direction and attributes (where required) 
in the other.

This would not take care of files that are uploaded to a server or sent 
via email (to non-Haiku users); but then, as pointed out by yourself in 
a separate message, Haiku is unique in many ways that it will require 
(re-)learning some stuff, and this is IMO one of those things.

All FWIW and IMHO. Cheers,

Jorge/aka Koki
