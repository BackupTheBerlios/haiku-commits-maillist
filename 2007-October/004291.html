+/*!
+	\class BMessage
+	\ingroup app
+	\brief A container that can be send and received using the Haiku messaging
+		subsystem.
+	
+	This class is at the center of the web of messaging classes, in the sense
+	that it defines the actual structure of the messages. Messages have two
+	important elements: the #what identifer, and the data members. The first
+	can be directly manipulated, the latter can be manipulated through
+	AddData(), FindData() and ReplaceData() and their deratives. Neither of
+	these elements are mandatory.
+	
+	The second important role of BMessage is that it stores meta data: who sent
+	the message and with what intention? The methods of BMessage will disclose
+	if the message was a reply (IsReply()), where it came from
+	(IsSourceRemote()), whether a reply is expected (IsSourceWaiting()), and in
+	case the message is a reply, what it's a reply to (Previous()).
+	
+	All methods can be classified in these areas:
+	- Adding, Finding, Replacing and Removing Data.
+	- Statistics and Miscelanous information.
+	- Delivery information.
+	- Utilities to reply to messages.
+	
+	To see how messages fit in with the greater picture, have a look at the
+	\ref app_messaging &quot;Messaging Introduction&quot;.

+	whether or not the message is a drop message or reply information, is
+	not copied. So if the original message is a reply to a previous message,

+	of the message will return \c false.

+	\fn status_t BMessage::AddData(const char *name, type_code type,
+	 	const void *data, ssize_t numBytes, bool isFixedSize, int32 count)
+	\brief Add \a data of a certain \a type to the message.
+	
+	The amount of \a numBytes is copied into the message. The data is stored
+	at the label specified in \a name. You are responsible for specifying the
+	correct \a type. The Haiku API already specifies many constants, such as
+	B_FLOAT_TYPE or B_RECT_TYPE. See TypeConstants.h for more information on
+	the system-wide defined types. 
+	
+	If the field with the \a name already exists, the data is added in an
+	array-like form. If you are adding a certain \a name for the first time,
+	you are able to specify some properties of this array. You can fix the size
+	of each data entry, and you can also instruct BMessage to allocate a
+	\a count of items. The latter does not mean that the number of items is
+	fixed; the array will grow nonetheless. Also, note that every \a name can
+	only be associated with one \a type of data. If consecutive method calls
+	specify a different \a type than the initial, these calls will fail.
+	
+	There is no limit to the number of labels, or the amount of data, but
+	note that searching of data members is linear, as well as that some
+	messages will be copied whilst being passed around, so if the amount of
+	data you need to pass is too big, find another way to pass it.
+	
+	\param name The label to which this data needs to be associated. If the
+		\a name already exists, the new data will be added in an array-like
+		style.
+	\param type The type of data. If you are adding data to the same \a name,
+		make sure it is the same type.
+	\param data The data buffer to copy the bytes from.
+	\param numBytes The number of bytes to be copied. If this is the first call
+		to this method for this type of data, and you set \a isFixedSize to
+		\c true, this will specify the size of all consecutive calls to this
+		method.
+	\param isFixedSize If this is the first call to this method with this
+		\a name, you can specify the whether or not all items in this array
+		should have the same fixed size.
+	\param count If this is the first call to this method with this
+		\a name, you can instruct this message to allocate a number of items in
+		advance. This does not limit the amount of items though. The array will
+		grow if needed.
+	
+	\retval B_OK The \a data is succesfully added.
+	\retval B_BAD_VALUE The \a numBytes is less than, or equal to zero (0), or
+		the size of this item is larger than the \a name allows, since it has
+		been specified to have a fixed size.
+	\retval B_ERROR There was an error whilst creating the label with your 
+		\a name.
+	\retval B_BAD_TYPE The \a type you specified is different than the one
+		already associated with \a name.
