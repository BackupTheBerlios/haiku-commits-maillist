<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Why don't you just add a dedicated bus driver for that instead of 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; misusing the PCI one?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I started before the new device layer.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The idea was to be able to reuse existing driver or code...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sure, but there is only very little to reuse - and it would be pretty 
</I>&gt;<i> easy to extend the generic IDE drivers to support another bus (as 
</I>&gt;<i> long 
</I>&gt;<i> as the module info is more or less compatible with PCI).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Yes, but how would that work with respect to old-style drivers ?
For simple ones it will be easier to fork existing ones, so to stick to 
isa/pci.

OTH I'm not sure how zorro PnP features would map to PCI.

&gt;<i> I think we should have a minimal bus_module_info that all busses 
</I>&gt;<i> should 
</I>&gt;<i> adhere to where it makes sense (that contains mainly I/O 
</I>&gt;<i> functionality).
</I>
Yes that's what I meant when I once talked about polymorphism.
A bus should be able to act like another &quot;standard&quot; one, either ISA(+
config_manager) or PCI.
This is what pccard is doing anyway on BeOS IIRC.
This would allow both simplifying drivers, and also allow using the old 
driver model without having to port everything now, as devices would be 
published on the &quot;fake&quot; bus.

Faking ISA would allow doing DMA on busses where the operation must be 
initialized on the chipset (on PCI it's done by the card becomming bus 
master.
Since ISA doesn't have notion of device info, we'd fake them from the 
config_manager.

Faking PCI would allow keeping the bus separation as it has the notion 
of bus number.
PCI also has interesting config infos, but most won't be usable anyway.
OTH, PCI allows a different memory space.

Both have a single io space anyway (read/write don't take bus number), 
but can be arranged to reroute part of that space, by mirroring devices 
on bus foo on specific addresses on the fake bus.
That's actually what I want to do on falcon, because some devices are 
mapped on odd or even bytes due to word-size IO.
So I'd fake a device with a specific address range, and the driver 
would just see contiguous registers (so doing -&gt;write_io_8(BAR+
REGFOO,v) would work) at the advertized address, and the fake isa bus 
backend will reroute that to real regs.


Ideally on the new architecture, a driver would handle a node, then 
publish nodes corresponding to the chips the card has, with io methods 
that would be able to do this, and also indexing (sending reg number at 
BAR and data at BAR+1, the SCSI chip on falcon is wired this way IIRC), 
so the driver handling the chip itself would always see a flat register 
window.

&gt;<i> And since many 68k platforms can have real PCI busses as well, it's 
</I>&gt;<i> just messy to do it this way.
</I>
I agree it's messy, but at least it's only for a single bus number, and 
allows to still support real bridges (the milan ones require specific 
page attributes anyway).

&gt;<i> &gt; Though probably only the IDE and SCSI controllers might be of 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; interest 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; here, and there is an ISA driver as well.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'll see if I can move it all to isa+config_manager.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The config_manager is supposed to go away, too; it doesn't serve any 
</I>&gt;<i> purpose anymore.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Well it's still useful to find things like PS/2 without hardcoding the 
address in the driver itself.
Like, my ppc mac clone has PS/2 too, but certainly not at the usual PC 
address...
the driver should just find PS/2 controllers by class instead of 
hardcoding.

Of course using the new bus managers would remove the need for it, but 
I don't feel like porting every driver, and it will take time anyway.

The cleanest way would be to have devices published on busses be 
snooped and just listed by config manager, so hardcoding will work for 
both types.

&gt;<i> &gt; Still, can we boot without a pci bus ? I guess it'll be interesting 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; see.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't see why this one should be mandatory.
</I>
I don't see either, but it's so ubiquitous I wouldn't bet on it.

&gt;<i> &gt; As for another bus, I didn't want to add a bus just for that, and 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; as 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; said it was before the change.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, the excuse is gone ;-)
</I>I'm still too lazy to read on the docs for the new arch... and I'd like 
to get something usable by RMLL.

&gt;<i> How's the 68k port progressing, anyway?
</I>
I now get a full image, and the boot loader finds it and tries to load 
the kernel, but I have stubs to fill, still (mmu, irq, timer).

&gt;<i>  Do you plan to add support for 
</I>&gt;<i> the Amiga as well?
</I>
Sure, but it's less easy as I don't know any emu that supports mmu, and 
I don't have a real one.

Fran&#231;ois.
