Ok! Thanks for doing that... I was just checking mails before going to bed, 
so feel free to dig in! From memory... I think the combined clipping is 
cached, so you might have to work around that. That's going to make it 
non-straight forward, in the sense that a decision might have to be made 
with regards to different &quot;speed trade-offs&quot;. Maybe you can add a flag to 
View::ScreenClipping() to indicate whether or not this is supposed to 
contain the user clipping, and remember what is contained in the cached 
clipping and then force rebuilding, but only if there is any user clipping 
defined at all, so that there is no impact for &quot;regular views&quot;.

Best regards,
-Stephan
