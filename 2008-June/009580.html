I'm not so sure about that. I only fixed messing with the painter draw state
without cleaning it up afterwards. This should only affect the case where the
decorator is drawn and then something in a view is drawn without the state
being explicitly set again inbetween. The decorator itself always sets the
used colors explicitly, so it should not affect decorator drawing at all.

That the decorator itself draws the zoom button wrongly (which is just drawing
two rectangles over eachother, it's not that one of them actually got
clipped), does look generally strange to me. It should not happen, as the
rects are always drawn one after the other. We are talking about
&quot;src/servers/app/DefaultDecorator.cpp&quot; and its _DrawZoom() method here and
looking through it I don't see how this would actually happen. It would be
like one thread drawing the gradients and then some other thread drawing the
gray rectangle over it at the same time or something like this.

Generally this default decorator is extremely inefficient. It always
calculates it's colors and then draws the lines individually. It doesn't even
use a line array. Setting each of the colors for the lines involves modifying
the painter high-color and drawing mode, doing the drawing with that modified
draw state and then (now with that commit) resetting the draw state back. Each
line itself in that process causes a blit on the graphics card, as they are
not combined in a line array, but do actual individual lines.

All of the drawing should be cached, probably simply blit-ready bitmaps should
be created for both button states and focus/non-focus cases. I will look into
this over the coming days, as I am looking through a few other drawing
glitches in that area anyway.

Michael
