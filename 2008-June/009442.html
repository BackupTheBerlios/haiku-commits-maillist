<PRE>Hi Stephan

&gt;<i> It looks pretty good. I am only considering using a different name 
</I>&gt;<i> like 
</I>&gt;<i> fScreenDrawingRegion, but maybe your choice it more clear from a 
</I>&gt;<i> different 
</I>&gt;<i> perspective.
</I>
I have pretty much left the other variables and just added the user and 
combined screen + user there. I haven't actually thought about renaming 
the existing stuff. So if you feel they could be renamed please do so.

&gt;<i> The only other thing I am not sure about is that background 
</I>&gt;<i> drawing ignores the user clipping. I am 99% sure I tested that and on 
</I>&gt;<i> BeOS 
</I>&gt;<i> the background clearing honors the user clipping.
</I>
When testing with the ClippingAndRedraw testapp under BeOS, once the 
clipping is set, the view background is still cleared to white (as 
default view color). If I set the view color to something else it is 
cleared to that other color, also when the update area is not within 
the user set clipping. You can easily check the behaviour with 
ClippingAndRedraw: Run the app, press space so clipping is set (to the 
red square area) and then click in the view twice so the floating 
window comes up and goes away again. The area behind the floating 
window will redraw with the current view color. If I constrain 
background clearing to the user clipping in the Haiku app_server (&quot;src/
servers/app/View.cpp line 1249 using ScreenAndUserClipping() instead of 
_ScreenClipping()) and do the same test under Haiku, the floating 
window will stay visible (even though it is gone) because the 
background is not cleared to the view color. Also when moving something 
over the window or moving the window offscreen you will see the obvious 
tearing happening because of no background being applied. If the 
app_server clears to the background ignoring the user clipping (like it 
currenlty is) the test app behaves exactly as under R5 however. The 
same is true when employing a view bitmap BTW, just checked that. The 
only thing I noticed is that when a view bitmap is set, the current 
clipping region is apparently redrawn for some reason, while this is 
not the case for R5. After all that should not matter though because 
this is not something an application could rely on (as it could be 
exposed and redrawn at any time anyway).

&gt;<i> Also have you tested the 
</I>&gt;<i> CopyBits() behavior on BeOS with regards to user clipping? Right now 
</I>&gt;<i> the 
</I>&gt;<i> user clipping would affect it, correct? It sounds odd that it would 
</I>&gt;<i> do 
</I>&gt;<i> that. Thanks a lot for all your work!
</I>
I haven't tested that yet at all. I assumed as it is a user initiated 
operation it would also honor the user set clipping, but I might not 
have fully understood what is supposed to happen with CopyBits(). Will 
investigate that and correct it to disregard user clipping if 
necessary.

Regards
Michael
