More or less completed the introduction. I would just want to add the image,
and publish it on the website - comments are still welcome, though.

 &lt;h4&gt;5.2. Writing a Simple Bus Driver&lt;/h4&gt;
 
-TODO: support for these drivers is still missing!
+&lt;p&gt;A bus can be simple in a number of ways:&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;ol&gt;
+&lt;li&gt;It may not know how many or if any devices are attached to it&lt;/li&gt;
+&lt;li&gt;It cannot retrieve any type information about the devices it has, but
+	knows all devices that are attached to it&lt;/li&gt;
+&lt;/ol&gt;
 
+&lt;p&gt;An example of the latter would be the Zorro bus of the Amiga - it only has
+information about the vendor and device ID, but no type information. It should
+be implemented like an intelligent bus, though, with the type information simply
+omitted.&lt;/p&gt;
 
-&lt;h3&gt;6. Open Issues&lt;/h3&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;Therefore, this section is about the former case, that is, a simple bus like
+the ISA bus. Since it doesn't know anything about its children, it does not
+publish any child nodes, instead, it will just specify the
+B_FIND_MULTIPLE_CHILDREN and B_FIND_CHILD_ON_DEMAND flags for its device node.
+Since there are no additional informations about this bus, the device manager
+will assume a simple bus, and will try to find drivers on demand only.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h4&gt;6.5. Unregistering Nodes&lt;/h4&gt;
 
+&lt;h4&gt;6.6. Support for generic drivers is missing&lt;/h4&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;This should probably be done by simply adding a simple bus driver named
+&quot;generic&quot; that generic drivers need to ask for.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;h4&gt;6.7. Mappings, And Other Optimizations&lt;/h4&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;Due to the way the device tree is built, the device manager could remember
+which driver served a given device node. That way, it wouldn't need to search
+for a driver anymore, but could just pick it up. Practically, the device manager
+should cache the type (and/or vendor/device) information of a node, and assign
+one or more drivers (via module name) to this information. It should also
+remember negative outcome, that is if there is no driver supporting the
+hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;This way, only the first boot would require an actual search for drivers, as
+subsequent boots would reuse the type-driver assignments. If a new driver is
+installed, the cached assignments would need to be updated immediately. If a
+driver has been installed outside of the running system, the device manager
+might want to create a hash per module directory to see if anything changed to
+flush the cache. Alternatively or additionally, the boot loader could have a
+menu causing the cache to be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;It would be nice to find a way for generic and simple busses to reduce the
+amount of searching necessary for them. One way would be to remember which
+driver supports which bus - but this information is currently only accessible
+derived from what the driver does, and is therefore not reliable or complete.
+A separately exported information would be necessary for this.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;Also, when looking for a generic or simple bus driver, actual directories
+could be omitted; currently, driver search is always recursive, as that's how
+the module mechanism is working. Eventually, we might want to extend the
+open_module_list_etc() call a bit more to accomplish that.&lt;/p&gt;
+
 &lt;/body&gt;
