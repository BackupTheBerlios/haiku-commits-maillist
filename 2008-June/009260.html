+&lt;h1&gt;Introduction to Haiku's Device Driver Architecture&lt;/h1&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;This document tries to give you a short introduction into the new device
+manager, and how to write drivers for it. Haiku still supports the legacy
+device driver architecture introduced with BeOS.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;The new device driver architecture of Haiku is still a moving target,
+although most of its details are already specificed.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+
+&lt;h3&gt;1. The Basics&lt;/h3&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;The device manager functionality builds upon &lt;i&gt;device_node&lt;/i&gt; objects.
+Every driver in the system publishes one or more of such nodes, building a
+tree of device nodes. This tree is in theory a dynamic representation of the
+current hardware devices in the system, but in practice will also contain
+implementation specific details; since every node comes with an API specific
+to that node, you'll find device nodes that only come with a number of support
+functions for a certain class of drivers.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;Structurally, a &lt;i&gt;device_node&lt;/i&gt; is a set of a module, attributes,
+and resources, as well as a parent and children. At a minimum, a node must
+have a module, all other components are optional.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+TODO: picture of the device node tree
+
+&lt;p&gt;When the system starts, there is only a root node registered. Only primary
+hardware busses register with the root node, such as PCI, and ISA on x86.
+Since the PCI bus is an intelligent bus, it knows what hardware is installed,
+and registers a child node for each device on the bus.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;Every driver can also publish a device in &lt;i&gt;/dev&lt;/i&gt; for communication with
+userland applications. All drivers and devices are kernel modules.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+
+&lt;h3&gt;2. Exploring the Device Tree&lt;/h3&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;So how does it all work? When building the initial device tree, the system only
+explores a minimum of device drivers only, resulting in a tree that basically
+only shows the hardware found in the computer.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;Now, if the system requires disk access, it will scan the device file system
+for a driver that provides such functionality, in this case, it will look for
+drivers under &quot;/dev/disk/&quot;. The device manager has a set of built-in rules for
+how to translate a device path into a device node, and vice versa: every node
+representing a device of an intelligent bus (such as PCI) will also contain
+device type information following the PCI definitions. In this case, the &quot;disk&quot;
+sub-path will translate into the &lt;i&gt;PCI_mass_storage&lt;/i&gt; type, and hence, the
+device manager will then completely explore all device nodes of that type.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;It will also use that path information to only ask drivers that actually
+are in a matching module directory. In the above example of a disk driver, this
+would be either in &quot;busses/scsi&quot;, &quot;busses/ide&quot;, &quot;drivers/disk&quot;, ...&lt;/p&gt;
+
+TODO: untyped/generic busses are not yet supported!
+
+
+&lt;h3&gt;3. Writing a Driver&lt;/h3&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;The device manager assumes the following API from a driver module:&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;ul&gt;
+&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;supports_device()&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
+	Determines wether or not the driver supports a given parent device node,
+	that is the hardware device it represents (if any), and the API the node
+	exports.&lt;/li&gt;
+&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;register_device()&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
+	The driver should register its device node here. The parent driver is
+	always initialized at this point. When registering the node, the driver
+	can also attach certain I/O resources (like I/O ports, or memory ranges)
+	to the node -- the device manager will make sure that only one node can
+	claim these resources.&lt;/li&gt;
+&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;init_driver()&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
+	Any initialization necessary to get the driver going. For most drivers,
+	this will be reduced to the creation of a private data structure that is
+	going to be used for all of the following functions.&lt;/li&gt;
+&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;uninit_driver()&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
+	Uninitializes resources acquired by &lt;b&gt;init_driver()&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
+&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;register_child_devices()&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
+	If the driver wants to register any child device nodes or to publish
+	any devices, it should do so here. This function is called only during
+	the initial registration process of the device node.&lt;/li&gt;
+&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;rescan_child_devices()&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
+	Is called whenever a manual rescan is triggered.&lt;/li&gt;
+&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;device_removed()&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
+	Is called when the device node is about to be unregistered when its
+	device is gone, for example when a USB device is unplugged.&lt;/li&gt;
+&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;suspend()&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
+	Enters different sleep modes.&lt;/li&gt;
+&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;resume()&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
+	Resumes a device from a previous sleep mode.&lt;/li&gt;
+&lt;/ul&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;To ensure that a module exports this API, it &lt;b&gt;must&lt;/b&gt; end its module name
+with &quot;driver_v1&quot; to denote the version of the API it supports. Note that
+&lt;b&gt;suspend()&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;resume()&lt;/b&gt; are currently never called, as Haiku has
+no power management implemented yet.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;If your driver can give the device it is attached to a nice name that can be
+presented to the user, it should add the &lt;b&gt;B_DEVICE_PRETTY_NAME&lt;/b&gt; attribute
+to the device node.
+&lt;p&gt;The &lt;b&gt;B_DEVICE_UNIQUE_ID&lt;/b&gt; should be used in case the device has a unique
+ID that can be used to identify it, and also differentiate it from other devices
+of the same model and vendor. This information will be added to the file system
+attributes of all devices published by your driver, so that user applications
+can identify, say, a USB printer no matter what USB slot it is attached to, and
+assign it additional data, like paper configuration, or recognize it as the
+default printer.&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;If your driver implements an API that is used by a support or bus module, you
+will usually use the &lt;b&gt;B_DEVICE_FIXED_CHILD&lt;/b&gt; attribute to specify exactly
+which child device node you will be talking to. If you support several child
+nodes, you may want to have a closer look at the section explaining
+&lt;a href=&quot;#bus_driver&quot;&gt;how to write a bus driver&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+
+&lt;h3&gt;4. Publishing a Device&lt;/h3&gt;
+
+To publish a device entry in the device file system under &lt;i&gt;/dev&lt;/i&gt;, all your
+driver has to do is to call the
+&lt;pre&gt;
+	publish_device(device_node *node, const char *path,
+		const char *deviceModuleName);
+&lt;/pre&gt;
+function the device manager module exports. The &lt;i&gt;path&lt;/i&gt; is the path
+component that follows &quot;/dev&quot;, for example &quot;net/ipro1000/0&quot;. The
+&lt;i&gt;deviceModuleName&lt;/i&gt; is the module exporting the device functionality.
+It should end with &quot;device_v1&quot; to show the device manager which protocol it
+supports. If the device node your device belongs to is removed, your device
+is removed automatically with it. On the other hand, you are allowed to
+unpublish the device at any point using the &lt;b&gt;unpublish_device()&lt;/b&gt; function
+the device manager delivers for this.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;A device module must export the following API:&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;ul&gt;
+&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;init_device()&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
+	This is called when the open() is called on this device for the first 
+	time. You may want to create a private data structure that is passed on
+	to all subsequent calls of the &lt;b&gt;open()&lt;/b&gt; function that your device
+	exports.&lt;/li&gt;
+&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;uninit_device()&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
+	Is called when the last file descriptor to the device had been closed.&lt;/li&gt;
+&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;device_removed()&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
+	When the device node your device belongs to is going to be removed,
+	you're notified about this in this function.&lt;/li&gt;
+&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;open()&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
+	Called whenever your device is opened.&lt;/li&gt;
+&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;close()&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
+	&lt;/li&gt;
+&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;free()&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
+	Free the private data structure you allocated in &lt;b&gt;open()&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
+&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;read()&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
+	&lt;/li&gt;
+&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;write()&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
+	&lt;/li&gt;
+&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;io()&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
+	This is a replacement for the &lt;b&gt;read()&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;write()&lt;/b&gt; calls,
+	and allows, among other things, for asynchronous I/O. This functionality
+	has not yet been implemented, though (see below).&lt;/li&gt;
+&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;control()&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
+	&lt;/li&gt;
+&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;select()&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
+	&lt;/li&gt;
+&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;deselect()&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
+	&lt;/li&gt;
+&lt;/ul&gt;
+
+
+&lt;h3&gt;5. &lt;a name=&quot;bus_driver&quot;&gt;Writing a Bus Driver&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;A bus driver is a driver that represents a bus where one or more arbitrary
+devices can be attached to.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;There are two basic types of busses: intelligent busses like PCI or USB that
+know a lot about the devices attached to it, like a generic device type, as
+well as device and vendor ID information, and simple untyped/generic busses that
+either have not all the information (like device type) or don't even know what
+and if any devices are attached. The device manager has been written in such a
+way that device exploration makes use of additional information the bus can
+provide in order to find a responsible device driver faster, and with less
+overhead.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;h4&gt;5.1. Writing an Intelligent Bus Driver&lt;/h4&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;If your bus knows what type of device is attached to, and also has vendor and
+device ID information about that device, it is considered to be an intelligent
+bus. The bus driver is supposed to have one parent node representing the bus,
+and to create a child node for each device attached to the bus.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;The additional information you have about the devices are attached to the
+device node in the following attributes:&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;ul&gt;
+&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;B_DEVICE_VENDOR_ID&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
+	The vendor ID - this ID has only to be valid in the namespace of your
+	bus.&lt;/li&gt;
+&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;B_DEVICE_ID&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
+	The device ID.&lt;/li&gt;
+&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;B_DEVICE_TYPE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
+	The device type as defined by the PCI class base information.&lt;/li&gt;
+&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;B_DEVICE_SUB_TYPE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
+	The device sub type as defined by the PCI sub class information.&lt;/li&gt;
+&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;B_DEVICE_INTERFACE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
+	The device interface type as defined by the PCI class API information.&lt;/li&gt;
+&lt;/ul&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;You can use the &lt;b&gt;B_DEVICE_FLAGS&lt;/b&gt; attribute to define how the device
+manager finds the children of the devices you exported. For this kind of bus
+drivers, you will usually only want to specify &lt;b&gt;B_FIND_CHILD_ON_DEMAND&lt;/b&gt;
+here, which causes the driver only to be searched when the system asks for it.
+&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;h4&gt;5.2. Writing a Simple Bus Driver&lt;/h4&gt;
+
+TODO: support for these drivers is still missing!
+
+
+&lt;h3&gt;6. Open Issues&lt;/h3&gt;
+
+While most of the new device manager is fledged out, there are some areas that
+could use improvements or are problematic under certain requirements. Also, some
+parts just haven't been written yet.
+
+&lt;h4&gt;6.1. generic/simple busses&lt;/h4&gt;
+
+&lt;h4&gt;6.2. Unpublishing&lt;/h4&gt;
+
+&lt;h4&gt;6.3. listdev functionality&lt;/h4&gt;
+
+The &quot;listdev&quot; command has been removed from the image, and it is currently not
+functional anymore.
+
+&lt;h4&gt;6.4. Versioning&lt;/h4&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;The way the device manager works, it makes versioning of modules (which are
+supposed to be one of the strong points of the module system) much harder or
+even impossible. While the device manager could introduce a new API and could
+translate between a &quot;driver_v1&quot;, and a &quot;driver_v2&quot; API on the fly, it's not
+yet possible for a PCI sub module to do the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Proposed Solution:&lt;/b&gt; Add attribute &lt;b&gt;B_DEVICE_ALTERNATE_VERSION&lt;/b&gt;
+that specifies alternate versions of the module API this device node supports.
+We would then need a &lt;b&gt;request_version()&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;set_version()&lt;/b&gt; function
+(to be called from &lt;b&gt;supports_device()&lt;/b&gt;) that allows to specify the version
+of the parent node this device node wants to talk to.&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;h4&gt;6.5. Unregistering Nodes&lt;/h4&gt;
+
+&lt;/body&gt;
+&lt;/html&gt;
