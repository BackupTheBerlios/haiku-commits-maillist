</I>
We have had this discussion a number of times... the argument is basically 
this:

* To have a limit makes sense,
* To have a soft limit doesn't make sense, because that's like having no 
limit,
* The 80 char limit is not totally arbitrary. If you look into 
configurations of various editors (Qt Creator, Geany), you will notice that 
they will often have an option to display a cut-off line, and they default 
to 80. I think it's some default Terminal width or something... also very 
useful for reading diffs in mails. It doesn't really matter what the limit 
is. What matters is that we have defined the limit and changing it doesn't 
make sense. If someone wants to work using a single big window on his 24&quot; 
screen, that's fine he can do that even with an 80 char limit. Other people 
have other workflows, and in some workflows, it is extremely annoying if 
some people didn't stick to the 80 char/line limit. Please, just do it.

Yes, this means if you're at 81, break up the line.

&gt;<i> Other question, what does the starting f in a member variable stands for?
</I>
I cannot answer that one. Again, the point is to have consistency.

Anyways, the frequent reminders about coding style may seem quite annoying. 
However, what is really annoying is that people who check in new code into 
the repo often don't stick to the guidelines, especially when they have 
been reminded already. We do frequently work in other peoples code, like 
for example if someone disappears or doesn't have time anymore. Haveing 
consistent guidelines makes this much more pleasant for everyone. Please, 
everyone, simply stick to the guide lines. Closely.

Best regards,
-Stephan
