Ok, I will have a look at that today.

Apart from the need to implement drag and drop for the composed characters 
resulting from pressing a dead key and a second key, I wonder if it makes 
sense to add support to the Keymap preflet for changing the dead keys at all, 
and if so, in what way. Three options came to my mind:

1. Do not bother to change anything and let the &quot;power user&quot; edit the keymap 
by hand.

2. Add a menu to the preflet where the user can chose from a given set of 
concrete dead key characters for each of the five dead keys:
   0xC2B4 and ' for Acute
   ` for Grave
   ^ for Circumflex
   0xC2A8 and &quot; for Diaeresis (maybe : too?)
   ~ for Tilde
This is easy to implement, but would lock the set of supported dead key 
characters.

3. Add one text control for each of the five dead keys, allowing the user to 
enter whatever character should be used as the trigger character for that 
specific dead key. This is obiously the most flexible, but would require 
quite some screen space and might be confusing for new users. Perhaps it 
could be moved to an 'Advanded' tab-page?

I personally like solution 2, as I find that the best compromise between 
simplicity and configurability.

Opinions, anyone?

cheers,
    Oliver
