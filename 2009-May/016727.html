</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We have had this discussion a number of times... the argument is 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; basically this:
</I>&gt;<i> ya I know sorry for that but thanks for the summery :) a short &quot;it is a 
</I>&gt;<i> standard&quot; or something like that would have satisfied  me :)
</I>
Sorry it I came across a little sore... :-) I didn't mean to for the most 
part. Thought this would end up in another challenge on the coding style 
guidelines.


&gt;<i> I'm reading every reminder trying to learn our coding style but it's hard 
</I>&gt;<i> to apply the standard if you are not the author :)
</I>
I feel your pain. For things that are not maintained anywhere else, it is 
of course preferred to transfer them into our coding style, but I fully 
realize that that may be a lot of work and costs time which one doesn't 
have or wants to spend in other ways...

&gt;<i> Last time I did a commit I made a diff and proof read that. Next check in 
</I>&gt;<i> will probably have a lot more errors as it's a lot of code and not 
</I>&gt;<i> produced by me (SpicyKeys).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A code style validation tool would be cool to have :)
</I>
We do have the guidelines written down, though, and they should be pretty 
much up to date. I have to use another style guide for work too and need to 
remember to switch between the two. I find it becomes more and more easy to 
do that quickly over time. :-)

Best regards,
-Stephan
