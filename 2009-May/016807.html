The point is, we have a coding style guide, and it's really not that 
hard to follow. The more often I have to point that out, the more 
annoyed I get of it, that's just natural.

&gt;<i> &gt; But anyway, this hides a bug in the disk device itself; according 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the BeBook, a driver should only return B_DEV_MEDIA_CHANGED once in 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; case there was a change: &quot;B_DEV_MEDIA_CHANGED. The media changed 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; since the time that the device was opened, or since the time of the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; last 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; B_GET_MEDIA_STATUS request.&quot;
</I>[...]
&gt;<i> I don't think it is wrong, it is just implemented in a way that works

</I>&gt;<i> It

</I>
This has nothing to do with what the disk device manager is doing (and 
actually it was me who implemented that).

&gt;<i> Right now 2 consecutive polls results in MediaChanged() being true 
</I>&gt;<i> and 
</I>&gt;<i> this probably happens because the device itself keeps this status for 
</I>&gt;<i> a 
</I>&gt;<i> while (althouhg I didn't go that deep). Whenever notifications are 
</I>&gt;<i> implemented, this will not be a problem I guess as we would get one 
</I>&gt;<i> notification (from the device, I mean. Right now we pool the device) 
</I>&gt;<i> and that would be all.
</I>
As I pointed out above, that's a bug in the device driver that should 
be fixed, it's completely independent from any notifications.

Bye,
   Axel.
