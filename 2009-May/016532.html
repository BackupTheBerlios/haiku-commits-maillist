It's really no big deal, Michael, I am sorry it has blown so much out of 
proportion. I am simply sometimes proof-reading commits and for a lot of 
code, it means I am proof-reading something that I don't know much 
about. I don't see the context either, only what shows up in the commit 
notification. In this case, I saw an &quot;fDeviceCount&quot; at one place and 
then later this non-obvious (to me) &quot;return 2;&quot; for a device number. It 
looked like it could be an error and if in doubt, I rather speak up, it 
has sometimes turned up real errors. I think your current solution with 
the comment above that line works very well, the define is probably not 
justified if it would be used in only that place.

Best regards,
-Stephan
