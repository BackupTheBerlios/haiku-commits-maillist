No, it wasn't like that. The bug got exposed after my first round of 
changes to the DrawState handling, in which I needed to reset the correct 
Painter state after the WindowLayer has drawn itself with the decorator. At 
that point, fCurrentLayer was used, appearently when it still pointed to a 
removed ViewLayer in case of DeskBar. The client didn't actually use the 
ViewLayer, it was just that the pointer was stale when the ServerWindow 
tried to use it by itself, without client request, when trying to restore 
the graphics state. The other bug was AS_SYNC being handled as a view 
message, which got exposed when I set fCurrentLayer to NULL after removing 
a view (then it wasn't handled anymore). It seems like ServerWindow thinks 
fCurrentLayer being NULL means no views have been attached at all yet, and 
that's why I used the parent ViewLayer, so that I didn't have to mess with 
this too much. I do seem to remember that it used to be like that too, 
before I got to code much on the app_server.

Best regards,
-Stephan
