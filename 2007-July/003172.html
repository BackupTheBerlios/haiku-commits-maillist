</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Tabbed browsing works in FireFox, I suppose, but what does it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; provide that the system doesn't already provide? Why would we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; want to increase this divide (app-context vs system-context)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; by having applications effectively hide extra windows?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Several reasons:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1) I like having a lot of different web sites open at once
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in my browser.
</I>
I use tabs too, to load new windows ahead of time, pre-caching.
But not because I think tabs are better than windows. I could just
as well use windows, if they wouldn't -cover- the current window.

I believe tabs are a suboptimal fix for bad window management.

&gt;<i> &gt; 2) I don't like manually managing lots of windows in general,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but especially when doing something like in 1.
</I>
I think something else is missing from window management.
I don't think tabs is the solution, but of course, it may not be an
unreversible disaster to add it to the mix.

&gt;<i> &gt; 3) When browsing I don't tend to switch contexts into 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; other applications as much,
</I>
Me too.

&gt;<i> &gt; and I find it easier just to look up at my tabs when 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; choosing what site to read next.
</I>
If FireFox would allow opening windows in the background
(or something similarly non-intrusive) and Deskbar still would
not be an okay choice, then Deskbar needs to be improved.

&gt;<i> &gt; On BeOS or Haiku I would be really annoyed having to click 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in the deskbar entry for the browser to get the window list 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to switch to another web site. 
</I>
Deskbar's window entries can (or should) be as clear and present as any 
FireFox tabs are, thanks to the &quot;Application Expanders&quot;. (Can we rename
/unname this please?)

Deskbar should allow resizing to show longer application and window 
names, and it should never be covered by an application, or cover an 
application itself. (Zoom should respect Deskbar.)

&gt;<i> &gt; I also tend to not use and dislike &quot;windows&quot; menus 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; within applications.
</I>
Me too.

&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 4) Having windows plus tabs allows two levels of 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; organization.
</I>
See reply to Krishna below.

 ...
&gt;<i> &gt; 5) Tabs allow spatial organization and I feel I develop a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; certain muscle memory 
</I>
The order of Deskbar entries would be the same as your tabs unless 
you've set it to sort by name. 

I know it's not exactly the same as fixed locations, but it's not like 
you keep the set of tabs open, all of them, each in the exact same spot 
for the entire session, right? I usually close them as I read them, 
starting from either the first or the last, sometimes randomly. I can't 
really use the initial tab order memory.

 ...
&gt;<i> &gt; The organization of windows or applications on deskbar or 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; other taskbar type systems is not as good.
</I>
Tabs may have been created as a multiplatform feature, or 
possibly to work around bad task bars, like that of Windows.

(Another aspect is that the window/page title and adress field
is at the top of the browser window, whereas Window's task
bar is at the bottom of the screen. A bad layout that doesn't 
reflect the hierarchy. A ribbon-like(?) layout would be better
with the apps on the first level, at the top of the screen, 
windows (tabs) on the next level and then window contents.)

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Even with system-standard tab-management keyboard 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; shortcuts it's hardly a step forward, IMO.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I disagree. Plus Ctrl-Tab or whatever shortcut is used for 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; switching tabs isn't much worse than Alt-Tab.
</I>

&gt;<i> I completely agree. Its basically the &quot;two levels of organisation&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> that helps. You tend to group all /similar/ tasks in tabs in a single
</I>&gt;<i> window. So you switch windows for a /dissimilar/ group of tasks and
</I>&gt;<i> switch tabs for /similar/ group of tasks.
</I>
We've already got two levels, sort of, in Deskbar, and in the switcher 
(alt-tab), a list of running applications, with sublists of windows. In
-window tabs add a conceptual third level, I think.

We've also got workspaces, for similar tasks, should you want to group 
them that way.

Well, I don't know. Perhaps it's not the end of the world to have tabs.
