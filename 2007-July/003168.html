</I>
Several reasons:

1) I like having a lot of different web sites open at once in my
browser. I frequently open links on a given site in several new tabs
and then read them in order as I get time. I suspect other people tend
to do this too. I find it easier to manage this as tabs rather than a
bunch of new windows.

2) I don't like manually managing lots of windows in general, but
especially when doing something like in 1.

3) When browsing I don't tend to switch contexts into other
applications as much, and I find it easier just to look up at my tabs
when choosing what site to read next. On BeOS or Haiku I would be
really annoyed having to click in the deskbar entry for the browser to
get the window list to switch to another web site. I also tend to not
use and dislike &quot;windows&quot; menus within applications.

4) Having windows plus tabs allows two levels of organization. I use
this for browsers and for terminals. For example right now on my
Ubuntu box at home I have one terminal with several tabs for
development, then a separate terminal window for console IRC, then
another one on another workspace with rtorrent running. I also really
like having all my IM conversations together in a tabbed window in
GAIM.

5) Tabs allow spatial organization and I feel I develop a certain
muscle memory for where certain sites are in the tab layout of a
browser. For example I usually put Gmail in the first tab. If I want
to check my mail I can get there pretty fast. The organization of
windows or applications on deskbar or other taskbar type systems is
not as good.

&gt;<i> Even with system-standard tab-management keyboard shortcuts
</I>&gt;<i> it's hardly a step forward, IMO.
</I>
I disagree. Plus Ctrl-Tab or whatever shortcut is used for switching
tabs isn't much worse than Alt-Tab.
