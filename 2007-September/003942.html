+1) What are the best values for --tftpd-timeout, --retry-timeout and
+    --max-thread ?
+
+There is no absolute answer to that question. It is highly dependent
+of your personnal setup. Here's an explanation of what they mean and
+how to tune them.
+
+--tftpd-timeout controls how much time the server will wait for an
+incomming connection before killing the main thread. If you use small
+number, the server will be respawned by inetd when a new query
+arrives. If number is high, atftpd will behave more like a standalone
+server in that it will always receive queries directly. When booting a
+whole cluster, the first tftp request will start the daemon and have
+higher latency. All other clients will be handled directly by the tftp
+server. It is a good idea to set the timeout high enough so that the
+main thread won't hog your system killing itself and respawning all
+the time.
+
+--retry-timeout controls how much time the server waits before
+retransmitting a packet. If you expect some lag on the network (when
+the network is under high load), it is a good idea to increase that
+value. Note that the client's delay must be taken into
+consideration. The client can set the server delay too, and it
+overides the --retry-timeout value.
+
+--max-thread controls how many simultaneous client may be served. This
+limit depends on your server's performance. It also depends on the
+maximum load you are willing to put on the server. For exemple, this
+server may have other things to do, and you want to limit the number
+of clients booting at the same time to 10. The maximum number of
+threads is also throttled by the available bandwidth of the network
+and server, because packet cannot be processed fast enough and there is
+a maximum rate at which servers may be started. But this is not a desirable
+condition and --maxthread should be set to avoid that.
+
+2) Why do I get &quot;recvfrom: Connection refused&quot; in my log file?
+
+That indicates that either your server or network can't handle all the
+packets fast enough. What happens is the following:
+	- client sends a RRQ (read request)
+	- server starts a thread (A) that sends a DATA packet
+	- the client times out and sends a second RRQ
+	- server A sends the whole file
+	- client and server thread A both exit normally
+	- server finally starts a second thread (B) for the second RRQ
+	- the server thread sends a DATA packet to the client
+	- the client isn't listenning anymore, we got a connection refused.
+
+Solution:
+	a) increase timeout on client and server side
+	b) reduce the number of concurrent thread allowed
+	c) do nothing, it's not harmfull at all.
+
+3) How can I boot a simple image from the network?
+
+A boot from LAN setup requires the following on the server side: a dhcp 
+server, a tftp server (atftpd), a working pxelinux config, a kernel image
+and a root file system image.
+
+You can get documentation on how to configure the dhcp server to work with
+pxelinux from the pxelinux and dhcp documentation.
+
+For atftp to work out of the box, be sure to have the following line in your
+inetd.conf and to restart the inetd daemon:
+    tftp dgram udp wait nobody /usr/sbin/tcpd /usr/sbin/in.tftpd /tftpboot
+
+You also need to have /tftpboot world readable.
+
+The pxelinux configuration is the same as syslinux. Documentation for it can
+be found in the syslinux package.
+
+The configuration file for pxelinux will tell it the name of the kernel and
+file system images to download. It is very important that you tell the kernel
+image where to get its root file system with rdev like this for example:
+
+    rdev image /dev/ramdisk
+
+You can find detailed information on how to create a filesystem image in the
+Bootdisk HOWTO (www.linuxdoc.org).
+
+On the client side, you need to have a boot ROM. Have a look at Etherboot
+(www.etherboot.org), NetTools and Nilo (www.nilo.org) to find out more
+information about this if you need to burn one.
+
+After you got all of these setup, you should see the client attempt to get
+an IP address on boot, download pxelinux.bin, then download the kernel and
+filesystem images and boot from it.
+
+
+4) I followed the above steps and it still fails to boot!
+
+Try putting log verbosity at high in the concerned programs on the server side
+and see if something fails or if you get the requests at all. You should see
+dhcpd give a lease to the client, if it doesn't, your dhcp configuration is
+faulty. You can also monitor the activity on the network to track down the
+problem using tools like tcpdump or ethereal.
+
+5) How do I setup multicast stuff?
+
+ - Make sure your client and server support multicast.
+ - Make sure you server routing table know what to do with multicast addresses.
+   You need to do something like this:
+	route add -net 224.0.0.0 netmask 240.0.0.0 dev eth0
+ - Make sure your network is working by testing with atftp client against
+   atftpd server
+
+That's currently all that I've made working folks. I've never tried a multicast
+boot ROM or boot loader yet.
+
+6) What inetd or xinetd configuration should I use?
+
+Something like that for inetd in /etc/inetd.conf:
+tftp dgram udp wait nobody /usr/sbin/tcpd /usr/sbin/in.tftpd &lt;insert options&gt;
+
+For xinetd, in /etc/xinetd.conf:
+service tftp
+{
+        socket_type = dgram
+        protocol = udp
+        wait = no
+        user = nobody
+        server = /usr/sbin/in.tftpd
+        server_args = &lt;insert atftpd options&gt;
+}
+
+This is the basic stuff. Read inetd or xinetd man page for more specialised
+configuration.

+The simplest way to install atftp is using either the Debian package
+or one provided by your distribution if any. If you need to install
+atftp from source, here's the procedure.
+
+
+1) Needed libraries
+   ----------------
+
+  libpthread     Needed for the atftpd server.
+  libwrap        Optional if you need host access control.
+  libpcre        Optional if you want to perform file name
+                 substitution. See README.PCRE.
+  libreadline    Optional. Used by the atftp client for better command
+                 line input and history.
+
+
+2) Needed tools
+   ------------
+
+  At least, you need these programs:
+    make
+    gcc
+  You may also need these:
+    cvs
+    automake	(tested using version 1.7 and 1.8)
+    autoconf 	(tested with version 2.50)
+
+
+3) How to compile
+   --------------
+
+ 3.1) From tarball
+
+  ./configure [options]         (this generates makefiles)
+  make                          (actually build the programs)
+  su -c 'make install'          (install files (default location is /usr)
+
+ 3.2) From cvs checkout
+
+  ./autogen.sh                  (this generate the configure script)
+  ./configure [options]         (this generate makefiles)
+  make                          (actually build the programs)
+  su -c 'make install'          (install files (default location is /usr)
+
+
+4) How to start atftpd server
+   --------------------------
+
+4.1) Using the inetd super server
+
+  Add this line to the /etc/inetd.conf file:
+
+    tftp dgram udp wait nobody /usr/sbin/tcpd /usr/sbin/in.tftpd /tftpboot
+
+  You can add needed option to atftpd as you which at the end of the
+  line.
+
+4.2) Using xinetd
+
+  Add this to the /etc/xinetd.conf file, or create /etc/xinetd.d/tftp-udp file
+  with the following content:
+
+  # tftp-udp
+  service tftp
+  {
+        id = tftp-udp
+        disable = no
+        socket_type = dgram
+        protocol = udp
+        wait = no
+        user = nobody
+        nice = 5
+        server = /usr/local/sbin/atftpd
+        server_args = /tftpboot  # add other server argument as necessary
+  }
+  # eof
+
+4.3) As a stand alone server from init.d scripts
+
+  You need to add the proper init script in you boot sequence. The
+  Debian package automatically does that. I'm not aware if any rpm based
+  distribution include init scripts. If you absolutely need this on rpm
+  based distribution or on other systems, start with the Debian
+  scripts and adapt it to your particular system.

+
+  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
+price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
+have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for

+if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
+in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
+
+  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
+anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
+These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
+distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
+
+  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
+gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
+you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
+source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
+rights.
+
+  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
+(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
+distribute and/or modify the software.

+  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
+that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
+software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
+want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
+that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
+authors' reputations.
+
+  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
+patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
+program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
+program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
+patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

+  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
+modification follow.
+
+		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
+   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
+
+  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
+a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
+under the terms of this General Public License.  The &quot;Program&quot;, below,
+refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot;
+means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
+that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
+either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
+language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
+the term &quot;modification&quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.
+
+Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
+covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
+running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
+is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
+Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
+Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
+
+  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
+source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
+conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
+copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
+notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
+and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
+along with the Program.
+
+You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
+you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
+
+  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
+of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
+distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
+above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
+
+    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
+    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
+
+    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
+    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
+    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
+    parties under the terms of this License.
+
+    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
+    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
+    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
+    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
+    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
+    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
+    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
+    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
+    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
+    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
+
+These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
+identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
+and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
+themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
+sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
+distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
+on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
+this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
+entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
+
+Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
+your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
+exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
+collective works based on the Program.
+
+In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
+with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
+a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
+the scope of this License.
+
+  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
+under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
+Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
+
+    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
+    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
+    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
+
+    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
+    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
+    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
+    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
+    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
+    customarily used for software interchange; or,
+
+    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
+    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
+    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
+    received the program in object code or executable form with such
+    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
+
+The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
+making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
+code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
+associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
+control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
+special exception, the source code distributed need not include
+anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
+form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
+operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
+itself accompanies the executable.
+
+If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
+access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
+access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
+distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
+compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
+
+  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
+except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
+otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
+void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
+However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
+this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
+parties remain in full compliance.
+
+  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
+signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
+distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
+prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
+modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
+Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
+all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
+the Program or works based on it.
+
+  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
+Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
+original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
+these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
+restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
+You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
+this License.
+
+  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
+infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
+conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
+otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
+excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
+distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
+License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
+may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
+license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
+all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
+the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
+refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
+
+If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
+any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
+apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
+circumstances.
+
+It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
+patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
+such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
+integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
+implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
+generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
+through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
+system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
+to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
+impose that choice.
+
+This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
+be a consequence of the rest of this License.
+
+  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
+certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
+original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
+may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
+those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
+countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
+the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
+
+  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
+of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
+be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
+address new problems or concerns.
+
+Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
+specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any
+later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions
+either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
+Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
+this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
+Foundation.
+
+  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
+programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
+to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
+Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
+make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
+of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
+of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
+
+			    NO WARRANTY
+
+  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
+FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
+OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
+PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
+OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
+MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
+TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
+PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
+REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
+
+  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
+WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
+REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
+INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
+OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
+TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
+YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
+PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
+POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
+
+		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
+
+	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
+
+  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
+possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
+free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
+
+  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
+to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
+convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
+the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
+
+    &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
+    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;
+
+    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
+    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
+    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
+    (at your option) any later version.
+
+    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
+    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
+    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
+    GNU General Public License for more details.
+
+    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
+    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
+    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
+
+
+Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
+
+If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
+when it starts in an interactive mode:
+
+    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year  name of author
+    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
+    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
+    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
+
+The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
+parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
+be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
+mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
+
+You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
+school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program, if
+necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
+
+  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
+  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.
+
+  &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1989
+  Ty Coon, President of Vice
+
+This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
+proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
+consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
+library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
+Public License instead of this License.
