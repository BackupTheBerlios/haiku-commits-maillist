Maybe I'm just tired and have been thinking about this too long, but I
don't see how this fixes it. If you consider my scenario earlier with
the 4 threads (which even do the &quot;proper&quot; locking of the mutex), the
end result would still be the semaphore with a +2 thread count:

Start: waiter_count = 0
Thread 1: locks mutex, calls cond_wait, event = 0, waiter_count = 1,
unlocks mutex, blocks on sem
Thread 2: locks mutex, calls cond_wait, event = 0, waiter_count = 2,
unlocks mutex, blocks on sem
Thread 3: locks mutex, calls cond_notify(, true), event_counter = 1,
sem released twice, context switch
Thread 4: tries to lock mutex (to call cond_notify), has to wait since
Thread 3 has it, blocks
Thread 1: unblocks, event (0) != event_counter (1), leaves loop, tries
to lock mutex, has to wait since Thread 3 still has it
Thread 2: unblocks, event (0) != event_counter (1), leaves loop, tries
to lock mutex, has to wait since Thread 3 still has it
Thread 3: returns from cond_notify, unlocks mutex
Thread 4: unblocks, locks mutex, calls cond_notify(, true),
event_counter = 2, sem released twice (erroneously)
Thread 1: unblocks, gets mutex, waiter_count = 1, returns from
cond_wait, unlocks mutex
Thread 2: unblocks, gets mutex, waiter_count = 0, returns from
cond_wait, unlocks mutex
waiter_count = 0, event_counter = 2, program continues
sem has incorrect +2 thread count

If you don't think so please explain how.

&gt;<i> There's a new race condition: Threads entering cond_wait() while another

</I>
This would only happen because of the loop, right? Because without the
loop it seems like it would work fine.

I am starting to see why people complain about threading, because
thinking about it stresses your mind quite a bit. But I think before
I'm done with this I will be less stressed than most ;)
