Looks correct. Nevertheless the original problem won't occur anymore. With 
your original implementation a thread calling cond_wait() after this 
sequence would immediately successfully acquire the semaphore and return, 
although it shouldn't. With the event counter version the thread will 
acquire the semaphore, but not leave the loop. The general idea is that a 
thread won't leave the loop until the event counter actually changes.

&gt;<i> &gt; There's a new race condition: Threads entering cond_wait() while another
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; thread is between atomic_add() and release_sem_etc() in cond_signal()

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; OK, since there would even be a race condition even if the whole
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; cond_signal() would be atomic.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This would only happen because of the loop, right? Because without the
</I>&gt;<i> loop it seems like it would work fine.
</I>
Yep, but removing the loop basically reverts the code to the original 
version, since the event counter would never be checked.

BTW, there's a second race condition, which could cause cond_signal(,false) 
to unblock two threads in cond_wait(), given that the previous semaphore 
count was erroneously greater than 0 and the thread calling cond_signal() 
would not hold the mutex (the detailed analysis be left as exercise for the 
motivated reader ;-)), but since that is standard conforming behavior, it 
doesn't matter anyway.

&gt;<i> I am starting to see why people complain about threading, because
</I>&gt;<i> thinking about it stresses your mind quite a bit. But I think before

</I>
Keeps the mind flexible, eh? :-P

CU, Ingo
