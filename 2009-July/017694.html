</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In what way did your configure invocation differ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, it's certainly not as clean as yours.  I kind of used some
</I>&gt;<i> hybrid of yours and what was the invocation from the previous optional
</I>&gt;<i> package.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yours:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ../gcc/configure --prefix=/boot/develop/tools/gnupro
</I>&gt;<i> --target=i586-pc-haiku --disable-nls --disable-shared
</I>&gt;<i> --disable-multilib --enable-languages=c,c++
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Mine:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ../gcc-4.3.3/configure
</I>&gt;<i> --prefix=/boot/develop/abi/x86/gcc4/tools/gcc-4.3.3-haiku-090702
</I>&gt;<i> --with-local-prefix=/boot/common
</I>&gt;<i> --oldincludedir=/boot/develop/headers/posix --disable-nls
</I>&gt;<i> --disable-multilib --disable-libstdcxx-pch --enable-shared=libstdc++
</I>&gt;<i> --enable-languages=c,c++
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Okay, naturally, first off I had my GCC in a different directory.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Secondly, I made my prefix kind of long, seeing as I just wanted to
</I>&gt;<i> install it to the right place upon make install.  I may do it your way
</I>&gt;<i> in the future though in the interest of length, readability, and
</I>&gt;<i> consistency amongst compiler builds, since using DESTDIR is simple
</I>&gt;<i> enough.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I specified a local prefix, whereas you didn't, and I used the
</I>&gt;<i> oldincludedir. These were present in the previous optional package as
</I>&gt;<i> well.  I assumed that the local prefix had to be set, since GCC
</I>&gt;<i> defaults to /usr/local if you don't specify it.  That said, it seems
</I>&gt;<i> like our haiku.h should cover all of that in the INCLUDE_DEFAULTS
</I>&gt;<i> section, hence making both with-local-prefix adn oldincludedir
</I>&gt;<i> redundant, I suppose.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You can see I didn't mention the target at all, as I saw no point
</I>&gt;<i> since I was building natively.  I also built a shared libstdc++ right
</I>&gt;<i> along with GCC to save a step.  I still had to make the shared
</I>&gt;<i> libsupc++ afterwards, so it didn't really save too much time.  I also
</I>&gt;<i> disabled precompiled headers during the build.  In the past I recall
</I>&gt;<i> the build bombing out because it was making some PCH at two different
</I>&gt;<i> optimization levels during the build, and then got confused.
</I>&gt;<i> Sometimes I also build with --disable-bootstrap since it saves me from
</I>&gt;<i> having to edit the makefile to avoid the build from bombing out when
</I>&gt;<i> the bootstrap comparisons fail.  Naturally the build is also way
</I>&gt;<i> faster overall this way.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I didn't try your GCC yet, but I assume it's safe to get rid of the
</I>&gt;<i> --with-local-prefix and --old-include-dir stuff then?
</I>
Hohum, I suppose I just missed most of that stuff, really. I'm not very 
familiar with build newer gcc releases, so it might very well be the case that 
my release contains bugs/problems.

&gt;<i> Some more questions...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> During the build, I always have fixincludes crash twice, and then the
</I>&gt;<i> build chugs along after that.  Did you have that issue?  If not,
</I>&gt;<i> that'd be cool, and must mean it's my invocation.
</I>
Yes, I've seen those, too. It feels kinda uncool to just let it continue, 
doesn't it?

&gt;<i> Have you ever had the PCH issue I mentioned?  I haven't seen if it was
</I>&gt;<i> the case this time around and just disabled it without checking, so
</I>&gt;<i> perhaps it's not even relevant anymore...or then again, it could be
</I>&gt;<i> invocation related.
</I>
I had that at the first try, at least I think that's what you refer to: the 
build stopped after stage3 with failures during the comparison of the stage2 
and stage3 compilers. Strangely enough, it worked when I tried again after a 
clean checkout.

cheers,
	Oliver
