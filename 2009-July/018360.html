About locale-awareness of the sorting : it's planned yes. std::set
allows the use of a curstom comparison function and i'll made use of
collators in there. But I haven't tested collators yet.

The purpose of the list is to select your preferred language(s) for
the catalog mechanism. Looking at the preflet design when I got it
from open tracker it looks like it was what was intended. There are 3
tabs :
-Language (for catalogs)
-Country (this is where we select the rest of the locale, ie number &amp;
date formatting)
-Keyboard (the keymap preflet was intended to be integrated in there)

Now, maybe this is not so good and could be reworked in a simpler
preflet allowing only selection of a country, and customization of the
formatting (number, date) things.

Actually I think the simplified approach (with only the Country tab)
would be better. It would also allow me to get rid of the BLanguage
class, which has no ICU counterpart (in ICU a locale is Country ||
Language (not needing both)) and the text orientation stuff is managed
internally by their Layout Engine.

Maybe a system similar to the keymap one (a list of default keymap and
the ability to define custom ones) would be the better. The process
would then be :

-Select a locale from the list
-Sample text, number, datetime and monetary formatting are shown
-Be happy with that or copy the locale and alter it for custom
settings (so the locale could get a name such as Custom-French). But
do we need that ?
In this case, what should we use as a locale name ? Country-Language
(as in France-French) will work but again we get a long list (with
Belgium-French, Switzerland-French, ...) whereas selecting the country
in a box and the language in another independant one make two shorter
lists. It allows more setting (I don't know if a thing such as
France-Spanish makes sense, but I'm sure there are some use cases for
this)

Another possibility is to set only the country and get a list of
available languages for this country (we can filter that out from the
full list of locales from ICU). I think ICU is complete enough to go
without a &quot;custom&quot; setting. That would match Haiku's &quot;sane defaults,
not too much settings&quot; philosophy.
