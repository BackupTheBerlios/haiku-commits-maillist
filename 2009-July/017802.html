The version of your code I have here at least does not seem to do it like 
that, it buffers/queues the packets for later use. And that's most likely 
why seeking didn't work, since streams are not really independent in 
libavformat.

&gt;<i> IIRC multiple instances like this was not really efficient cpu-wise... :-(
</I>
Hm. I would think the CPU intensive part is the decoding, not the demuxing. 
And like I mentioned, the multiple context approach has the advantage that 
there is no need to queue and buffer packets (for which one has to do 
copies), like it is done in all the FFmpeg examples I read, including 
ffplay itself. There is also the situation, where AVI files have all the 
video chunks first in the file and then all the audio chunks. If 
libavformat does nothing to manually interleave such streams so that audio 
packets do arrive inbetween video packets, then one would end up buffering 
the entire video in RAM when trying to read the first audio packet. With my 
solution, it would read (and discard) all the video packets, but it would 
at least work. Though as I said, if libavformat detected the problem, then 
it could work the &quot;regular&quot; way as well. In any case, I think the only CPU 
overhead that my solution has is that the demuxer is detected again for 
every stream. This could even be worked around if I would copy the 
AVInputFormat instance from the first stream.

Anyways, I am currently trying to get &quot;mpegts&quot; to work. My AVCHD video 
camera produces such streams (h264 + ac3 5.1), and with ffplay compiled on 
Ubuntu, they do play. I knew that VLC can play such streams and so I am 
relieved that it is indeed because of FFmpeg providing the support for 
that.So far I figured out how to use AVProgram based demuxing and I think I 
am demuxing the video packets correctly.  Unfortunately, I have so far only 
got a black picture, but I am already figuring out if the problem may be in 
the AVCodecDecoder, perhaps.

Best regards,
-Stephan
