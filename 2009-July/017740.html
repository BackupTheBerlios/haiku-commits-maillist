</I>
As far as I've understood it these are used for gathering includes to fix
during the fixincludes step.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> During the build, I always have fixincludes crash twice, and then the

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> that'd be cool, and must mean it's my invocation.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yes, I've seen those, too. It feels kinda uncool to just let it continue,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> doesn't it?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Indeed it does.  I've been meaning to investigate it, but kind of

</I>&gt;<i> the 4.4 patch I have for things that seem to be left over from the 
</I>&gt;<i> BeOS days. I think I'll try building the latest 4.4 snapshot of that 
</I>&gt;<i> later today with those changes to see if that magically changes 
</I>&gt;<i> anything, haha.
</I>
It doesn't only feel uncool, it will produce packages that have missing
&quot;fixed&quot; includes. These fixes are mostly only relevant to very strict
software, but I think if they weren't needed they wouldn't be produced.

If this is still the same crash as always, I am pretty sure I've
worke-around/fixed this a few times already. I don't see the workaround
anymore, so it might have been lost again. If it is the same crash it'll be in
the &quot;fixfixes.c&quot; and relate to the filename for the temporary file. I think it
was &quot;basename&quot; failing but I don't really remember.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Have you ever had the PCH issue I mentioned?
</I>
Yes, these existed for 4.3.3 as well. I think just disabling them should be fine.

&gt;<i> No, that is the bootstrap comparison problem I talked about.  I
</I>&gt;<i> generally get around that by building via --disable-bootstrap or else
</I>&gt;<i> commenting out the three lines in the makefile that produce an error
</I>&gt;<i> if there is a bootstrap comparison failure.
</I>
The bootstrap comparison as it is done by default (using a simple &quot;cmp&quot;
invokation) is documented to be only working on some platforms. It states that
for some platforms it will always fail. This is related to how padding parts
of the binaries are initialized. On Haiku this seems just random, so a
comparison like that will likely fail. To get it working you can either just
comment the comparison out, or use a comparison that actually compares the
produced code. To do that I've used a comparison based on objdump
disassembling both versions and compare that instead, while doing the 4.3.3
work. I might have that somewhere still, would need to check.

Regards
Michael
