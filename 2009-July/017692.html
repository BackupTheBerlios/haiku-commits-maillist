Yeah, it's no big deal.  As a quick pointer, the Binutils 2.19.1 patch
from the GNU FTP applies cleanly to the Binutils we have now (2.19).
The GMP/MPFR stuff I did was unnecessary too, as I don't really think
we should bother with them in the repository until at least MPFR 2.4.2
is out...or at all.  2.4.1 seems to have some tests that bomb out with
GCC 4.4.x thus far in my testing.

&gt;<i> In what way did your configure invocation differ?
</I>
Well, it's certainly not as clean as yours.  I kind of used some
hybrid of yours and what was the invocation from the previous optional
package.

Yours:

../gcc/configure --prefix=/boot/develop/tools/gnupro
--target=i586-pc-haiku --disable-nls --disable-shared
--disable-multilib --enable-languages=c,c++


Mine:

../gcc-4.3.3/configure
--prefix=/boot/develop/abi/x86/gcc4/tools/gcc-4.3.3-haiku-090702
--with-local-prefix=/boot/common
--oldincludedir=/boot/develop/headers/posix --disable-nls
--disable-multilib --disable-libstdcxx-pch --enable-shared=libstdc++
--enable-languages=c,c++

Okay, naturally, first off I had my GCC in a different directory.

Secondly, I made my prefix kind of long, seeing as I just wanted to
install it to the right place upon make install.  I may do it your way
in the future though in the interest of length, readability, and
consistency amongst compiler builds, since using DESTDIR is simple
enough.

I specified a local prefix, whereas you didn't, and I used the
oldincludedir. These were present in the previous optional package as
well.  I assumed that the local prefix had to be set, since GCC
defaults to /usr/local if you don't specify it.  That said, it seems
like our haiku.h should cover all of that in the INCLUDE_DEFAULTS
section, hence making both with-local-prefix adn oldincludedir
redundant, I suppose.

You can see I didn't mention the target at all, as I saw no point
since I was building natively.  I also built a shared libstdc++ right
along with GCC to save a step.  I still had to make the shared
libsupc++ afterwards, so it didn't really save too much time.  I also
disabled precompiled headers during the build.  In the past I recall
the build bombing out because it was making some PCH at two different
optimization levels during the build, and then got confused.
Sometimes I also build with --disable-bootstrap since it saves me from
having to edit the makefile to avoid the build from bombing out when
the bootstrap comparisons fail.  Naturally the build is also way
faster overall this way.

I didn't try your GCC yet, but I assume it's safe to get rid of the
--with-local-prefix and --old-include-dir stuff then?

Some more questions...

During the build, I always have fixincludes crash twice, and then the
build chugs along after that.  Did you have that issue?  If not,
that'd be cool, and must mean it's my invocation.

Have you ever had the PCH issue I mentioned?  I haven't seen if it was
the case this time around and just disabled it without checking, so
perhaps it's not even relevant anymore...or then again, it could be
invocation related.

In any case, I mostly like your invocation better, as it was on my
TODO list to try to  trim any more possible fat off of mine.

Oh yeah, and I noticed you put all HTML documentation instead of
having &quot;man&quot; documentation.  I didn't expect that one.  :)

Well, that's it for now.
