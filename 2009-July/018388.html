There is a BCollator class as well in the Locale Kit... - and this even 
worked at some point, even though you will probably rebase it on ICU 
now :-)

&gt;<i> The purpose of the list is to select your preferred language(s) for
</I>&gt;<i> the catalog mechanism. Looking at the preflet design when I got it
</I>&gt;<i> from open tracker it looks like it was what was intended. There are 3
</I>&gt;<i> tabs :
</I>&gt;<i> -Language (for catalogs)
</I>&gt;<i> -Country (this is where we select the rest of the locale, ie number &amp;
</I>&gt;<i> date formatting)
</I>
Yep, that's how I imagined it, although for the language, you should be 
able to choose more than one, in case not all applications are 
available in your preferred language - this one would then try to fall 
back to your second choice etc.
If the language list is too large, maybe grouping it (in a 
BOutlineListView) by continent would help, similar to what the Time 
preferences are doing.

&gt;<i> -Keyboard (the keymap preflet was intended to be integrated in there)
</I>
I am not sure about that last one anymore. I guess there is some 
brainstorming needed about how to deal with this - I don't think the 
Locale preferences should contain all the stuff Keymap can do now, at 
least.

&gt;<i> Now, maybe this is not so good and could be reworked in a simpler
</I>&gt;<i> preflet allowing only selection of a country, and customization of 
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> formatting (number, date) things.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Actually I think the simplified approach (with only the Country tab)
</I>&gt;<i> would be better. It would also allow me to get rid of the BLanguage
</I>&gt;<i> class, which has no ICU counterpart (in ICU a locale is Country ||
</I>&gt;<i> Language (not needing both)) and the text orientation stuff is 
</I>&gt;<i> managed
</I>&gt;<i> internally by their Layout Engine.
</I>
Actually the separation makes sense and is on purpose: for example, 
when you live in a foreign country, you will probably want to use the 
country's monetary and measurement settings, but still use your native 
language for the applications.
In any case, it's not a good idea to throw away BLanguage - this 
separation is also something accessible via the POSIX API, so ICU must 
be able to deal with this, too.

&gt;<i> Maybe a system similar to the keymap one (a list of default keymap 
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> the ability to define custom ones) would be the better. The process
</I>&gt;<i> would then be :
</I>
I wouldn't mind having everything on the first tab, and then the 
pecularities only on a second tab that you'll therefore will only need 
rarely. I'm just against getting rid of this completely in the app.

&gt;<i> Another possibility is to set only the country and get a list of
</I>&gt;<i> available languages for this country (we can filter that out from the
</I>&gt;<i> full list of locales from ICU). I think ICU is complete enough to go
</I>&gt;<i> without a &quot;custom&quot; setting. That would match Haiku's &quot;sane defaults,
</I>&gt;<i> not too much settings&quot; philosophy.
</I>
As a default, this would certainly work, but as said before, the 
advanced settings should still be accessible somehow.

Bye,
   Axel.
