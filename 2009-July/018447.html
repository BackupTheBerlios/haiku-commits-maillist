<PRE>&gt;<i> I think it would probably be best to have two lists - one with all
</I>&gt;<i> languages, and one with the preferred ones where their order matters.
</I>&gt;<i> Since it doesn't really make much sense to group languages by
</I>&gt;<i> continent, maybe have the ten most common ones in the first tree level,
</I>&gt;<i> and the other ones grouped by first letter? Like:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i> English
</I>&gt;<i> Spanish
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i> A -&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;...
</I>&gt;<i> B -&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;...
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>
I'll go for that. At least I'll add two lists.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Or also use the BLanguage::Family() information.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> -ICU don't offer anything about languages. Actually they use the same
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> class, Locale, for representing a coutry (with or without language)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and a language. The only information you can get about a language
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there is the two-letter ISO code and the readable name. We don't have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the keyword system yet, however, maybe that will bring some more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> info.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But as there is nothing like even the script direction, I think the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> BLanguage class would only have a constructor (taking the 2 letter
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> code as a parameter) and one single method, getReadableName(). It
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sounds a bit strange to have a class just for that. But it can be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> done.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why would one want to limit the locale kit to ICU provided information
</I>&gt;<i> in this case?
</I>&gt;<i> If it doesn't provide all the information we need, just have another
</I>&gt;<i> source of information that covers this case.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes, that's what I ended up doing. But it mean we have to provide this
info for all of the languages in the list. For example, if we use the
&quot;family&quot; to sort languages in the preflet, a lot of languages would
probably stay in the &quot;unknown&quot; family. But we can also decide this
mean they are not supported (as no one bothered adding them to haiku,
and this would mean there is no catalog available for them either).
So, I'll keep the BLanguage class not using ICU for now, and I'll bind
it to ICU only for the &quot;get 2-letter code from full name&quot; part.

Ah, I also noticed that BLanguage is instancied from a full name (for
example &quot;English&quot;). While this particular case is OK, ICU reports
things such as &quot;English-based creole or Pidgin&quot; and I'm not sure that
would work well (I can imaginne someone trying to instanciate a
&quot;Pidgin&quot; BLanguage. So I was thinking of modifying the constructor to
use the ISO code instead.

&gt;&gt;<i> -I borrowed the date&amp;time preferences from tracker. I'm converting it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to use the layout engine. But maybe there will be some changes to it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to better fit ICU API.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would guess so :-)
</I>&gt;<i> It also makes sense to have a look at how other systems deal with
</I>&gt;<i> problems like these - they either implemented good ideas, or can serve
</I>&gt;<i> as a bad example and inspire better ideas.
</I>
I think I'll keep this part for a mater step actually. Now I'll
concentrate on language setup only. Thanks for the help designing this
preflet properly :)

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Bye,
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; Axel.
