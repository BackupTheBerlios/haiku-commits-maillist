</I>&gt;<i> &gt; BeOS days. I think I'll try building the latest 4.4 snapshot of that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; later today with those changes to see if that magically changes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; anything, haha.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It doesn't only feel uncool, it will produce packages that have missing
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;fixed&quot; includes. These fixes are mostly only relevant to very strict
</I>&gt;<i> software, but I think if they weren't needed they wouldn't be produced.
</I>
Well, all I can say is that the result (i.e. the set of files in include-fixed) 
matches the ones from earlier releases of gcc-4.3.3. It just contains limits.h 
and syslimits.h.

&gt;<i> If this is still the same crash as always, I am pretty sure I've
</I>&gt;<i> worke-around/fixed this a few times already. I don't see the workaround
</I>&gt;<i> anymore, so it might have been lost again. 
</I>
According to svn log, there never were any changes to fixfixes.c, so if you can 
still dig up those changes, please commit them (or send them to me).

&gt;<i> If it is the same crash it'll be in
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;fixfixes.c&quot; and relate to the filename for the temporary file. I think it
</I>&gt;<i> was &quot;basename&quot; failing but I don't really remember.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; Have you ever had the PCH issue I mentioned?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, these existed for 4.3.3 as well. I think just disabling them should be 
</I>&gt;<i> fine.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; No, that is the bootstrap comparison problem I talked about.  I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; generally get around that by building via --disable-bootstrap or else
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; commenting out the three lines in the makefile that produce an error
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; if there is a bootstrap comparison failure.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The bootstrap comparison as it is done by default (using a simple &quot;cmp&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> invokation) is documented to be only working on some platforms. It states that
</I>&gt;<i> for some platforms it will always fail. This is related to how padding parts
</I>&gt;<i> of the binaries are initialized. On Haiku this seems just random, so a
</I>&gt;<i> comparison like that will likely fail. To get it working you can either just
</I>&gt;<i> comment the comparison out, or use a comparison that actually compares the
</I>&gt;<i> produced code. To do that I've used a comparison based on objdump
</I>&gt;<i> disassembling both versions and compare that instead, while doing the 4.3.3
</I>&gt;<i> work. I might have that somewhere still, would need to check.
</I>
That'd be great - I'd really prefer to be able to create our buildtools 
natively in a clean way (i.e. without any crashes or random failures).

cheers,
	Oliver
