</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ID in the upper layer, ie the &quot;format + codec ID&quot; to Decoder plug-in 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mapping. To be honest, I find the solution quite elegant.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I would probably add a new user-data like field, eventually with an

</I>
I know, and I wouldn't change that. The difference is that right now, it 
has to use it's CodecTable, and someone has had to add all possible 
combinations. For example, someone adds &quot;h246&quot; as ID and put 
B_AVI_FORMAT_FAMILY there. Now someone else writes a Reader which puts 
B_QUICKTIME_FORMAT_FAMILY into the media_format and the stream happens to 
be h264 encoded. Bad luck, the perfectly capable h264 Decoder will not be 
used. So the CodecTable is extended for the combo &quot;h264&quot; and 
B_QUICKTIME_FORMAT_FAMILY. Suddenly it works. The thing here is that FFmpeg 
supports tons of formats and decoders. What I propose would change the 
behavior of the AVCodecDecoder just for that format family only, which is 
that it wouldn't try to find a codec in it's codec table, but directly use 
the libavcodec codec ID (which the Reader put there) to find a decoder. 
Since both the Reader and Decoder sit in the same addon, there would not by 
any library version issues. All that being said, I still haven't looked at 
the issue that J&#233;r&#244;me pointed out. Maybe that just means I cannot share the 
AVCodecContext instance, but I could at least put the codec ID instead of 
the fourcc tag there.

Best regards,
-Stephan
