Alright, I suppose we'll see what happens then, hehe.  At least if
something comes up we'll have some idea where to look.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that'd be cool, and must mean it's my invocation.

</I>&gt;<i> Yes, I've seen those, too. It feels kinda uncool to just let it continue,
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't it?
</I>
Indeed it does.  I've been meaning to investigate it, but kind of just
ignored it for now.  I did make some other little changes in the 4.4
patch I have for things that seem to be left over from the BeOS days.
I think I'll try building the latest 4.4 snapshot of that later today
with those changes to see if that magically changes anything, haha.

&gt;&gt;<i> Have you ever had the PCH issue I mentioned?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I had that at the first try, at least I think that's what you refer to: the
</I>&gt;<i> build stopped after stage3 with failures during the comparison of the stage2
</I>&gt;<i> and stage3 compilers. Strangely enough, it worked when I tried again after a
</I>&gt;<i> clean checkout.
</I>
No, that is the bootstrap comparison problem I talked about.  I
generally get around that by building via --disable-bootstrap or else
commenting out the three lines in the makefile that produce an error
if there is a bootstrap comparison failure.

I found what I am referring to in one of my older build logs:

/boot/home/Downloads/GCC/440/gcc-4.4.0/libstdc++-v3/include/precompiled/extc++.h:29:28:
warning: /boot/home/Downloads/GCC/440/440build/i586-pc-haiku/libstdc++-v3/include/i586-pc-haiku/bits/stdtr1c++.h.gch/O2g.gch:
too short to be a PCH file
In file included from
/boot/home/Downloads/GCC/440/gcc-4.4.0/libstdc++-v3/include/precompiled/extc++.h:29:
/boot/home/Downloads/GCC/440/440build/i586-pc-haiku/libstdc++-v3/include/i586-pc-haiku/bits/stdtr1c++.h:29:25:
warning: /boot/home/Downloads/GCC/440/440build/i586-pc-haiku/libstdc++-v3/include/i586-pc-haiku/bits/stdc++.h.gch/O0g.gch:
not used because `__NO_INLINE__' not defined

Maybe that was just a problem with Haiku at the time though when I was
building.  I do remember around that time that I had to keep changing
libio.h  around to get things like PPL (optional for GCC 4.4) to
build.  That issue has been fixed in the meantime.  In any case, I'm
fairly certain the PCH error occurred with GCC 4.3.3 (not just 4.4.0
as you see above).  Naturally, it happens way late in the build, so it
is always a let down when it happens.  I started just unconditionally
using --disable-libstdcxx-pch since it was bugging me way too much.
I'll give a go without it on my next 4.4-related build to see what
happens.
