Ironically I'm not even a Pe user (yet), it just seemed that most of
the Haiku developer's liked it. If the design isn't great and the code
has a troublesome license then I could understand a desire to
&quot;reinvent.&quot; It is just sometimes we software guys reinvent for no good
reason. But hey, most of us on this project are involved for fun, and
if we want to write something that is &quot;yet another such and such&quot; just
for the fun and experience, then so be it. Obviously I am writing yet
another web browser (though I think most of us agree there is a need
for it.)

&gt;<i> vim is ancient, grown GNU software; I wouldn't even
</I>&gt;<i> consider having a closer look at it.
</I>
Yeah I would not expect Vim to get embedded in any of Haiku's code. It
was just another example for my list. It isn't really GNU software
though, AFAIK. It was mainly written by Bram Moolenaar and is licensed
as charityware. But even if it isn't GNU I'm sure there is a very
&quot;Unixy&quot; feel to the code. After all it is a reinvention of a classic
Unix editor.

&gt;<i> AFAIK Paladin is based on Pe. I only
</I>&gt;<i> had a quick look at Niue, but it didn't look promising to me, neither
</I>&gt;<i> license- nor code-wise.
</I>
OK, I trust your judgement.

Given all this I assume there are eventual plans for an
Ingo-designed-and-implemented programmer's editor? I think we all
would be pleased by that. Of course all in due time, finish up this
debugger first :)
