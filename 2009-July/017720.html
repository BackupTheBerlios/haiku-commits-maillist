I wouldn't exactly call it &quot;impact&quot;... like I said, it's really no biggy.

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; All websites I know are using a smaller font than 1em, including the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Haiku website, so I don't think this is much of a problem.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I am sorry to say, but that is not a convincing argument at all. 1em is

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I can agree with your argumentation. It just seemed like a quick fix. I 
</I>&gt;<i> do think when surfing around the web and then hitting the user guide, 
</I>&gt;<i> it's first like... whoa... big! &quot;Haiku, the OS for the elderly&quot;? :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Should this issue be further discussed (on the general mailing list)? Or 
</I>&gt;<i> chould I revert right away?
</I>
I think the real problem is that Firefox doesn't use the system font size 
for it's internal 1em font size. For example, the Haiku website seems to be 
exactly the system font size at 0.9em. 1.0em is indeed too large (i.e. 
larger than the system font). But as I said, the problem should IMHO be 
fixed in Firefox. Maybe you should just keep that change until Firefox or 
another browser will use the system font as 1.0em. Maybe that's 
problematic, though, for some other reason and browsers cannot do that 
without breaking other things...


Best regards,
-Stephan
