<PRE>Now I see that this message also got to the list, so I will repost my answer
here...

Ah, another one of those temporary solutions ;-)

Yeah, it's quite neat, but in fact the performance of most USB sticks sucks
for the usage pattern a booting Haiku has (they are usually meant for larger
bulk transfers). Also loading of applications from such devices is slow
(especially Firefox for example that involves many small reads and writes).
Installing to a BFS on such a device usually takes ages too because of the
many small files written and the generally poor write performance of most
flash media.
In the process of optimizing CD boot we will probably automatically speed up
this kind of device too though.

&gt;<i> BTW how do you want us to proceed with this thing? Originally, my

</I>
Well, the new driver architecture again... In fact, the problem with usb_scsi
is not really the USB side of things. The problem there is the changed SCSI
interface. I am not sure that moving the USB stack will really bring any
benefit there.

Then there is the general question of usb_scsi vs. usb_disk. With the current
USB stack, writing USB drivers is pretty straight forward and simple. And the
way things work really fits the hotplugging architecture of USB. So doing a
driver like usb_disk which dynamically reacts and publishes raw nodes makes a
lot of sense and works nicely. The usb_scsi module simply has to do more work
here as it needs to bridge between the USB and SCSI architecture. Currently
usb_scsi will just reserve fake entries in the SCSI bus and then &quot;fill&quot; them
when something is plugged in. This approach has the problem of being very
inflexible. If devices provide more LUNs than reserved for example or you
simply plug in more devices than you reserved, these resources won't be
accessible. Of course when we do a full port we would also fix this by dynamic
publishing of devices.

It's really a question of work. Getting USB mass storage to work with a driver
like usb_disk is just way easier to do and requires less work than porting
over usb_scsi. I tried a few times to actually get usb_scsi ported, so did
others, but it seems just a lot of work and one really easily gets stuck. On
the other hand I hacked up usb_disk and now disk monitoring and rescanning so
that hotplugging works in just a few days of work and it works perfectly well.

So in the end, after the new driver architecture is finalized and we see real
benefit in it we should revisit this and attempt to cleanly port over
usb_scsi. But for now I don't see the need to invest any more time into that
when we can get the same functionality with less effort.

Michael
