Nope.

BTW, this is a perfect application for kernel tracing, since you can 
analyze afterwards what mimeset was doing. Enable at least syscall (+ 
ignore ktrace_output()) and team tracing, and maybe also BMessage tracing. 
If it was a syscall that failed, you will know. It might also be an error 
that occurred on the registrar side, in which case you'll have to check 
what the MIME manager thread was doing at that time.

To find the last mimeset team do a:

	traced 0 -1 -1 and &quot;#team exec&quot; #mimeset

Afterwards you can trace backwards what the team was doing. If it isn't a 
syscall that is the cause of the problem, it might be something in mimeset 
or libbe. Additional debug output (ktrace_printf() for kernel tracing) 
should help to track it down.

I would recommend using a bigger tracing buffer than the default (I usually 
use 200 MB, which should last for a while, though not for the whole build 
process). For more infos about kernel tracing, I vaguely remember someone 
wrote an article that should be on the website. :-)

CU, Ingo
