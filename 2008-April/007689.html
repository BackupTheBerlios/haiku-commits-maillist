<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; IIRC some events are supposed to generate signals (SIGPIPE ?), 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; except
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; when being waited on by select().
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Haven't heard of that yet. The select() specification doesn't seem to 
</I>&gt;<i> refer 
</I>&gt;<i> to anything in that respect. SIGPIPE is generated by write()s to a 
</I>&gt;<i> closed 
</I>&gt;<i> pipe or socket. SIGURG is generated when out-of-band data arrive on a 
</I>&gt;<i> socket. 
</I>&gt;<i> To my knowledge neither is influenced by select().
</I>
I was quite sure there was something with select and signals, but maybe 
I invented that part.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But it's probably a bad idea to generate a signal to a thread when 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; actually a kernel descriptor in question, so knowing it in 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; [de]select()
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; might help (re)setting flags to generate or not a signal.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Likewise open/close calls should also know about the fd being 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; passed is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for the kernel or not.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There is no such thing as a kernel or userland file descriptor. The 
</I>&gt;<i> only 
</I>&gt;<i> difference between calls from kernel and userland in this respect is 
</I>&gt;<i> which 
</I>&gt;<i> file descriptor table is indexed (the one of the kernel or the one of 
</I>&gt;<i> the 
</I>&gt;<i> userland team). The referred to file descriptors have no kernel/
</I>&gt;<i> userland 
</I>&gt;<i> indication -- they couldn't anyway, since they can be shared by the 
</I>&gt;<i> kernel 
</I>&gt;<i> and userland teams.
</I>
While there is no difference on the structure itself as you said there 
is a contextual difference, that's what I meant.
It's probably a bad securitywise to let the kernel use a team's fd 
though anyway.
Still, as I said, sending a signal to a user thread when it's indeed a 
kernel fd that is causing the condition is generally a bad idea.

&gt;<i> &gt; I didn't look but is it semantically the same as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is_syscall() ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For some calls it simply indicates whether the call was made from a 
</I>&gt;<i> syscall 
</I>&gt;<i> or from within the kernel. It's main purpose is for interpreting the 
</I>&gt;<i> parameters passed to the call, e.g. if a supplied data buffer is 
</I>&gt;<i> supposed to 
</I>&gt;<i> reside in userland or if a given relative path has to be intepreted 
</I>&gt;<i> relative 
</I>&gt;<i> to the working directory of the current team or that of the kernel.
</I>
Yes that's the point.
Linux did it differently IIRC (we had that discussions long ago 
already), it hacked a value indicating the last (or first, can't 
remember) user allowed address, so when calling from the kernel the 
copy_to/from_user functions would be fooled and accept kernel buffers.
Though it's not semantically exactly the same...

It's probably cleaner with an is_syscall() func.
I thought I saw you called it on the socket module, is it a hook there 
or a plain kernel export ? it's probably simpler to export from the 
kernel, drivers shouldn't need to load the network stack to use that.

Fran&#231;ois.
