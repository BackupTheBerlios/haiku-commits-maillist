</I>&gt;<i> Log:
</I>&gt;<i> * Revised boot splash artwork, the logo is back in the lower right corner,
</I>&gt;<i>   the icons are centered.
</I>
Well, so nobody else answered to that so far. But I really have to. This is a
highly subjective matter of course, so all this is IMHO.

To make it short, I really don't like this change. At first, there was only
the logo at the lower right corner - that looked ok. Then there was the logo
centered on top of that neat white line and the animated icons - this really
looked great, very modern and I immediately fell in love with it. If the whole
block of logo+line+icons was vertically centered it would have been perfect IMHO.
Now we have both, the logo in the lower right corner and the animated icons.
But they do not really &quot;connect&quot; anymore (for lack of a better word). It looks
to me like both items were just thrown into the bootscreen.
Then there is another problem that I noticed on my laptop. I have a native
resolution of 1280x800 so it is a widescreen display. The bootscreen will be
1024x768 though and is centered with two black bars on each side. Now the
placement of the logo is even more wired as it is actually not in the lower
right corner anymore but just &quot;somewhere&quot; in the lower part of the screen. The
vertically and horizontally centered approach obviously didn't have this problem.

So afterall I guess I just wanted to note that I liked the previous version
far better and maybe bring that up for discussion. I for one would find it
nice if we could have the previous version back.

Regards
Michael
