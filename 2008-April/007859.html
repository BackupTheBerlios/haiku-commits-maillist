No. A few commands use the info from the passwd/group DBs, but save for &quot;su&quot; 
and &quot;login&quot; it is not vital (e.g. &quot;ls&quot; will show uid/gid instead of 
user/group name, if the info is not available).

&gt;<i> &gt; Anyway, I put the that stuff into the registrar mainly because it is the

If the registrar is gone, the system will be unusable. Just try and kill it 
under Haiku. Running apps might continue to work to a certain degree, but 
will behave oddly. The best you can do in such a situation is save your 
unsaved documents (if that does still work), wait until the data are really 
on disk (if you're so lucky to have a Terminal open, you can &quot;sync&quot; at 
least), and reboot. You won't be able to start applications or get the 
running ones into a working state again.

&gt;<i> &gt; If the reliability of the server is a real concern, adding a fallback
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; implementation to the relevant functions (getpwent_r() and getspent_r(), I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; suppose) isn't a big deal.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>
Restarting the registrar won't help with already running apps and it won't 
enable you to start new applications either. Almost all servers are BServers 
and their inter-app messaging and other services rely on the registrar. 
Unless you manage to restart them all, you're out of luck. Since your running 
apps are toast at any rate, restarting the machine is definitely the easiest 
way in such a case.

CU, Ingo
