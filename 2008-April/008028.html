</I>
Wait a sec, that case it definitely taken, because it has just a few  
lines before adjusted sems count (sem-&gt;u.used.count) by adding back  
the original acquisition count the unblocking thread moved it. The  
entire while loop is taken if the waking thread pushes the count &gt; 0,  
because then it has to test to see if additional threads have to be  
woken up. It then walks through the list, testing each thread in order  
to see if they had previously pushed the count negative, releases them  
(well, puts em on a list to be released), and then adjusts the count  
as if they had been released as well.

I think the bug here isn't the algorithm, but probably one of the  
counts has gotten out of whack, or is negative when should be  
positive, etc. I don't see anything obviously wrong with it. I *do*  
think it's totally guilty of being confusing and poorly documented  
though. I'm not even positive this is broken as you think, I know I  
tested the hell outta this back in newos, since all sorts of code  
relies on this particular behavior (rw locks, specifically). Could be  
some rot somewhere else snuck in, or the kill path is causing  
something to get out of whack.

&gt;&gt;<i> Also, I guess looking at the state the sem is in after the run would

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dont have a box handy and set up to look at it or I'd take a look
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> myself.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't intend to investigate this any further; I've already  
</I>&gt;<i> rewritten that
</I>&gt;<i> part. I just stumbled on it, because I'm in the process of reworking  
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> locking primitives. I'm introducing a set of functions
</I>&gt;<i> (thread_prepare_to_block(), thread_block(), thread_unblock(),...),  
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> will be commonly used by and thus simplify the semaphore and condition
</I>&gt;<i> variable code. They can also be used as a cheap locking means for  
</I>&gt;<i> other
</I>&gt;<i> places (tty, pipes, Unix sockets).
</I>
Yeah, that's probably the best way. At some point I started a complete  
rewrite of all the locking primitives in newos, because, well, the  
beos model is pretty lame. In later kernels i've written I generally  
follow a similar strategy of building generic wait queues and then  
building other primitives out of it. I'm kind of fond of the windows  
style locking primitives nowadays (event, mutex, single count sem,  
etc), since it's much easier to do wait on multiple objects and do  
proper priority inheiritance.
