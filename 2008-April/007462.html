</I>Some comments from my side, if you don't mind, ok? ;-D

</I>&gt;<i> Well, the new driver architecture again... In fact, the problem with usb_scsi
</I>&gt;<i> is not really the USB side of things. The problem there is the changed SCSI
</I>&gt;<i> interface. I am not sure that moving the USB stack will really bring any
</I>&gt;<i> benefit there.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>In case we will get a more &quot;traditional&quot; SCSI CAM support - all that 
driver-related glue should gone, I hope. :-)
&gt;<i> Then there is the general question of usb_scsi vs. usb_disk. With the current
</I>&gt;<i> USB stack, writing USB drivers is pretty straight forward and simple. And the
</I>&gt;<i> way things work really fits the hotplugging architecture of USB. So doing a
</I>&gt;<i> driver like usb_disk which dynamically reacts and publishes raw nodes makes a
</I>&gt;<i> lot of sense and works nicely. The usb_scsi module simply has to do more work
</I>&gt;<i> here as it needs to bridge between the USB and SCSI architecture. Currently
</I>&gt;<i> usb_scsi will just reserve fake entries in the SCSI bus and then &quot;fill&quot; them
</I>&gt;<i> when something is plugged in. This approach has the problem of being very
</I>&gt;<i> inflexible. If devices provide more LUNs than reserved for example or you
</I>&gt;<i> simply plug in more devices than you reserved, these resources won't be
</I>&gt;<i> accessible. Of course when we do a full port we would also fix this by dynamic
</I>&gt;<i> publishing of devices.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>If we left all those &quot;reservation&quot; tricks out of this discussion scope, 
usb_scsi behave like a filter - just transfer SCSI commands to usb-based 
hardware. Ideally this should be no difference is it works with USB 
connected HDD, CD, floppy or tape mass storages. SCSI sub-system 
determine the type of connected hardware self and decide which dev 
entries should be published - hard disk, cd, tape etc. In case we go 
&quot;usb_disk way&quot; - we have to implement also usb_cd driver, usb_floppy 
driver and usb_tape driver for every command set.

&gt;<i> It's really a question of work. Getting USB mass storage to work with a driver
</I>&gt;<i> like usb_disk is just way easier to do and requires less work than porting
</I>&gt;<i> over usb_scsi.
</I>There are lot of transport protocols (Bulk,CB, CBI) and command sets 
(SCSI, UFI, ATAPI, RBC, QIC157).  :-(  There are really many 
&quot;vendor-protocol&quot; usb mass storages that require some small quirks to be 
used as standard.

&gt;<i> I tried a few times to actually get usb_scsi ported, so did
</I>&gt;<i> others, but it seems just a lot of work and one really easily gets stuck. On
</I>&gt;<i> the other hand I hacked up usb_disk and now disk monitoring and rescanning so
</I>&gt;<i> that hotplugging works in just a few days of work and it works perfectly well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So in the end, after the new driver architecture is finalized and we see real
</I>&gt;<i> benefit in it we should revisit this and attempt to cleanly port over
</I>&gt;<i> usb_scsi. But for now I don't see the need to invest any more time into that
</I>&gt;<i> when we can get the same functionality with less effort.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>If you remember, before usb_scsi module was developed there was &quot;usb 
disk&quot; driver from one of Japan developers. It supported CBI-transfers 
only and was a disk driver not a SCSI CAM module. The life is like 
verses - not repeated but rhymed. :-)

Anyway, Michael, it is just comments. :-) Thank you for your effort!
