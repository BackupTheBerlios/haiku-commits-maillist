The changes:

* Formerly all FS hook functions were provided by the 
file_system_module_info. Now the only functions left there are the disk 
device related ones and the mount() hook. Hooks for operations on nodes are 
in the new fs_vnode_ops structure. The hooks not operating on nodes but on a 
mounted volume are in the new structure fs_volume_ops.

* The signature of all hooks changed: Instead of the file system's volume 
cookie (void*, formerly typedefed to fs_volume) they do now get a fs_volume*, 
which points to a structure containing the FS's volume cookie.

* The signature of all hooks operating on nodes changed additionally: Instead 
of the file system's node cookie (void*, formerly typedefed to fs_vnode) they 
do now get a fs_vnode*, which points to a structure containing the FS's node 
cookie.

* The fs_cookie typedef to void* is gone. void* is to be used instead.

* The mount() hook has changed: It gets a fs_volume* parameter as first 
argument. When mounting is successful, it has to set the 
fs_volume::private_node to its volume cookie and fs_volume::ops to the 
operations for that volume.

* The get_vnode() hook has changed: It also returns the node's type (as in 
struct stat::st_mode) and flags (which should be 0 ATM). The FS's node 
cookie, which was formerly returned through a void** (respectively fs_vnode*) 
parameter is now to be set in the fs_vnode structure passed to the function 
(the fs_vnode::private_node field). Additionally the fs_vnode::ops field has 
to be set.

* The lookup() hook no longer needs to return the node type.

* New hooks have been added: fs_volume_ops::{create,delete}_sub_vnode and 
fs_vnode_ops::create_special_node()/get_super_vnode(). create_special_node() 
can be implemented in a traditional file system to support creating fifos and 
sockets. The other hooks are needed for FS layers only.

* The signature of the VFS support functions 
{new,publish,get,put,remove,unremove}_vnode(), and get_vnode_removed() has 
changed. Instead of the ID of the volume (dev_t) an fs_volume* has to be 
passed.

* The signature of the VFS support function publish_vnode() changed some 
more: It additionally gets a fs_vnode_ops*, as well as the node type and 
flags as parameter (same as for the get_vnode() hook: type as in struct 
stat::st_mode, flags should be 0).

-------------------

How to adjust an existing FS is pretty straight along the lines of the 
changes list:

* Move the existing FS hooks into new fs_volume_ops and fs_vnode_ops typed 
variable definitions. Typical names are sFooFSVolumeOps, sFooFSNodeOps.

* Change the first parameter of all hooks. It was an fs_volume or void* and 
must be an fs_volume*. Important: Every use of the argument must be adjusted 
as well -- a &quot;-&gt;private_volume&quot; has to be appended. Often one of the first 
lines of a hook implementation is something like &quot;FooVolume* volume = 
(FooVolume*)_volume;&quot; (assuming _volume is the name of the first parameter). 
Due to the C cast, the compiler won't detect a missing &quot;-&gt;private_volume&quot;. 
This will usually result in a KDL (and hopefully no data corruption).

* Change the node cookie parameter of the node operation hooks. It was an 
fs_vnode or void* and should be an fs_vnode*. Pretty much the same holds as 
for the previous item. A &quot;-&gt;private_node&quot; has to be appended to every 
occurrence of the argument.

* Replace fs_cookie by void*. Search &amp; replace...

* Adjust the mount() hook: Assuming the first parameter of the new signature 
is named &quot;volume&quot;, set volume-&gt;private_volume instead of the no longer 
existing reference parameter. Also set volume-&gt;ops to &amp;sFooFSVolumeOps. 
Usually the FS stores the volume ID in its private cookie. Change this to 
store the fs_volume* instead (or additionally if more convenient -- 
fs_volume::id contains the ID, though).

* Adjust the get_vnode() hook: Assuming its new fs_vnode* parameter is named 
&quot;vnode&quot;, set vnode-&gt;private_node instead of the no longer existing reference 
parameter. Also set vnode-&gt;ops to &amp;sFooFSNodeOps. Normally the stat data for 
the node are available in that function. Set *_type to the st_mode field. Set 
*_flags to 0.

* Adjust the lookup() hook: Remove the obsolete type parameter and all 
occurrences.

* Adjust all calls to {new,publish,get,put,remove,unremove}_vnode(), and 
get_vnode_removed(). Pass the fs_volume* stored in the FS's volume cookie. 
Or, since all hooks have the fs_volume* as a parameter anyway, pass this one.

* Adjust calls to publish_vnode(): Additionally pass &amp;sFooFSNodeOps, the 
st_mode for the node type and 0 for flags.


-------------------


Unfortunately most of it is not straight search &amp; replace. Care must be take 
to correctly replace the new fs_volume* and fs_vnode* parameters. My 
recommendation is to do that in two passes for each (first the signatures 
(maybe search &amp; replace, if the previous naming is consistent), then the uses 
of the parameter (maybe search and replace or double click &amp; paste each)). It 
helps to give the parameters new names (in doubt use obscure ones and search 
&amp; replace them back when done), since then the compiler will tell you about 
all missed occurrences.

Good luck!

CU, Ingo
