That doesn't necessarily increase the semaphore count above 0, though. As 
in my test case: The initial sem count is 1. After the three blocking 
acquisition attempts (2, 1, 2) it is -4. When thread 1 is interrupted, it 
increases the sem count to only -2, and thus the loop is not taken, 
although thread 2 should be unblocked.

&gt;<i> The
</I>&gt;<i> entire while loop is taken if the waking thread pushes the count &gt; 0,
</I>&gt;<i> because then it has to test to see if additional threads have to be
</I>&gt;<i> woken up.
</I>
As written before, the count &gt;= 0 case is not challenging, because it means 
the acquisition count of every waiting thread is satisfied. The relatively 
tricky part is &lt; 0.

&gt;<i> It then walks through the list, testing each thread in order
</I>&gt;<i> to see if they had previously pushed the count negative, releases them
</I>&gt;<i> (well, puts em on a list to be released), and then adjusts the count
</I>&gt;<i> as if they had been released as well.
</I>
Which is also wrong, since they have not been released -- their acquisition 
count must not be adjusted (actually it should be, but by a value that is 
not available anymore (*)). Furthermore the sem count must not be touched 
in the loop at all.

(*) Since release_sem_etc() adjusts the thread acquisition count, we lose 
information. E.g. semaphore with initial count 0. A thread tries to acquire 
with count 2, the sem count changes to -2. Another thread releases count 1. 
Sem count changes to -1, thread acquisition count to 1. When the blocking 
thread is interrupted or times out, it adjusts the sem count to 0, although 
it should correctly become 1.

CU, Ingo
