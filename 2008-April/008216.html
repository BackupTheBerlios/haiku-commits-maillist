Yes, of course, but I happen to disagree with him on this too so the 
fact that he said it does not really help. :P

&gt;<i> In the post I quoted, Linus made some good remarks on why spaces suck with 
</I>&gt;<i> regards to looking at patches.
</I>
I do an averago of, say, 5 code-reviews every single day. Some of then 
have a delta of more than 1000 lines and touch dozens of files. I never 
ever had any problems because of spaces being used instead of tabs. 
Maybe I am just used to it but, if this is really the case, then his 
point is as valid as saying that Windows is the best OS around because 
most people are used it. :)

&gt;<i> We do look a lot at patches.
</I>
See above.

&gt;<i> All that aside, I made some arguments of my own, of which the most important one I may 
</I>&gt;<i> repeat: we have a huge codebase, and I don't think it is justified to 
</I>&gt;<i> change something that fundamental for the arguments you gave. None of your 
</I>&gt;<i> arguments convinced me.
</I>
And, again, I am not saying we should. I was just expressing a personal 
opinion. I would certainly not volunteer to go through all the code base 
and change the style. Of course this is also a moot point considering 
that, probably, there is more code that do not follow our style 
guideline (because it came from other sources) than code that does 
follow it.

The point is, a style guide is just some standard that was defined by 
someone because he/she was confortable with that. It does not mean it is 
good. :)
