Absolutely. And I fully agree that we will need such a bridge at one point.
The example of cdrecord by Stephan was a really good one. For this to work
over an eventual usb_cd driver you would almost certainly have to add backend
code to cdrecord which in case of a &quot;simple&quot; SCSI-USB bridge is completely
unnecessary.

</I>
In fact those are becoming less and less. Microsoft helps here, as they
discourage anything other than bulk-only and transparent SCSI. In fact I've
read that the RBC protocol is not even supported under Windows.

Anyway from the protocol standpoint of view it again makes no real sense to
support other protocols besides SCSI in usb_scsi. Because then you again do
translation. As soon as you have to do that you could in fact just as well
implement it as a driver.

&gt;<i> If you remember, before usb_scsi module was developed there was &quot;usb 
</I>&gt;<i> disk&quot; driver from one of Japan developers. It supported CBI-
</I>&gt;<i> transfers only and was a disk driver not a SCSI CAM module. The life 
</I>&gt;<i> is like verses - not repeated but rhymed. :-)
</I>
Yes, I took a look at that and it is basically the same thing. As I already
started out and quickly got to a point where everything worked nicely I didn't
really feel intrigued to reuse any code. It actually did support bulk-only,
but it never worked because of a bug in the BeOS USB stack - kinda ironic.

&gt;<i> Anyway, Michael, it is just comments. :-) Thank you for your effort!
</I>
They are appreciated - And I really hope that you do not feel offended by my
efforts. As I said, usb_scsi is fine and we should port it over cleanly at
some point. It's just that for the current needs a simpler approach that gets
most of the current target devices working seemed a better choice.

Regards
Michael
