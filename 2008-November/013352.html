</I>
Real lossless JPEG rotation is not destructive and it's the fool-proof 
method. A lot of cameras do not come with an orientation sensor. I can tell 
you from a lot of experience that real rotation is definitely needed. The 
world is just full of half-finished, half-tested products. If we ever 
managed to have every HAIKU program read the EXIF information from the 
photos, or if the translator already returned rotated photos - nice! But 
then you copy everything to a USB drive, plug it into your TV set top box 
and realize that the photos are not properly rotated anymore, but in this 
moment you're really frustrated, because a large chunk of your family is 
sitting in the living room waiting and thinking you can't handle your gear.

Best regards,
-Stephan
