+1 Notes on the Free Translation Project
+***************************************
+
+Free software is going international!  The Free Translation Project is
+a way to get maintainers of free software, translators, and users all
+together, so that free software will gradually become able to speak many
+languages.  A few packages already provide translations for their
+messages.
+
+   If you found this `ABOUT-NLS' file inside a distribution, you may
+assume that the distributed package does use GNU `gettext' internally,
+itself available at your nearest GNU archive site.  But you do _not_
+need to install GNU `gettext' prior to configuring, installing or using
+this package with messages translated.
+
+   Installers will find here some useful hints.  These notes also
+explain how users should proceed for getting the programs to use the
+available translations.  They tell how people wanting to contribute and
+work on translations can contact the appropriate team.
+
+   When reporting bugs in the `intl/' directory or bugs which may be
+related to internationalization, you should tell about the version of
+`gettext' which is used.  The information can be found in the
+`intl/VERSION' file, in internationalized packages.
+
+1.1 Quick configuration advice
+==============================
+
+If you want to exploit the full power of internationalization, you
+should configure it using
+
+     ./configure --with-included-gettext
+
+to force usage of internationalizing routines provided within this
+package, despite the existence of internationalizing capabilities in the
+operating system where this package is being installed.  So far, only
+the `gettext' implementation in the GNU C library version 2 provides as
+many features (such as locale alias, message inheritance, automatic
+charset conversion or plural form handling) as the implementation here.
+It is also not possible to offer this additional functionality on top
+of a `catgets' implementation.  Future versions of GNU `gettext' will
+very likely convey even more functionality.  So it might be a good idea
+to change to GNU `gettext' as soon as possible.
+
+   So you need _not_ provide this option if you are using GNU libc 2 or
+you have installed a recent copy of the GNU gettext package with the
+included `libintl'.
+
+1.2 INSTALL Matters
+===================
+
+Some packages are &quot;localizable&quot; when properly installed; the programs
+they contain can be made to speak your own native language.  Most such
+packages use GNU `gettext'.  Other packages have their own ways to
+internationalization, predating GNU `gettext'.
+
+   By default, this package will be installed to allow translation of
+messages.  It will automatically detect whether the system already
+provides the GNU `gettext' functions.  If not, the included GNU
+`gettext' library will be used.  This library is wholly contained
+within this package, usually in the `intl/' subdirectory, so prior
+installation of the GNU `gettext' package is _not_ required.
+Installers may use special options at configuration time for changing
+the default behaviour.  The commands:
+
+     ./configure --with-included-gettext
+     ./configure --disable-nls
+
+will, respectively, bypass any pre-existing `gettext' to use the
+internationalizing routines provided within this package, or else,
+_totally_ disable translation of messages.
+
+   When you already have GNU `gettext' installed on your system and run
+configure without an option for your new package, `configure' will
+probably detect the previously built and installed `libintl.a' file and
+will decide to use this.  This might not be desirable.  You should use
+the more recent version of the GNU `gettext' library.  I.e. if the file
+`intl/VERSION' shows that the library which comes with this package is
+more recent, you should use
+
+     ./configure --with-included-gettext
+
+to prevent auto-detection.
+
+   The configuration process will not test for the `catgets' function
+and therefore it will not be used.  The reason is that even an
+emulation of `gettext' on top of `catgets' could not provide all the
+extensions of the GNU `gettext' library.
+
+   Internationalized packages usually have many `po/LL.po' files, where
+LL gives an ISO 639 two-letter code identifying the language.  Unless
+translations have been forbidden at `configure' time by using the
+`--disable-nls' switch, all available translations are installed
+together with the package.  However, the environment variable `LINGUAS'
+may be set, prior to configuration, to limit the installed set.
+`LINGUAS' should then contain a space separated list of two-letter
+codes, stating which languages are allowed.
+
+1.3 Using This Package
+======================
+
+As a user, if your language has been installed for this package, you
+only have to set the `LANG' environment variable to the appropriate
+`LL_CC' combination.  If you happen to have the `LC_ALL' or some other
+`LC_xxx' environment variables set, you should unset them before
+setting `LANG', otherwise the setting of `LANG' will not have the
+desired effect.  Here `LL' is an ISO 639 two-letter language code, and
+`CC' is an ISO 3166 two-letter country code.  For example, let's
+suppose that you speak German and live in Germany.  At the shell
+prompt, merely execute `setenv LANG de_DE' (in `csh'),
+`export LANG; LANG=de_DE' (in `sh') or `export LANG=de_DE' (in `bash').
+This can be done from your `.login' or `.profile' file, once and for
+all.
+
+   You might think that the country code specification is redundant.
+But in fact, some languages have dialects in different countries.  For
+example, `de_AT' is used for Austria, and `pt_BR' for Brazil.  The
+country code serves to distinguish the dialects.
+
+   The locale naming convention of `LL_CC', with `LL' denoting the
+language and `CC' denoting the country, is the one use on systems based
+on GNU libc.  On other systems, some variations of this scheme are
+used, such as `LL' or `LL_CC.ENCODING'.  You can get the list of
+locales supported by your system for your language by running the
+command `locale -a | grep '^LL''.
+
+   Not all programs have translations for all languages.  By default, an
+English message is shown in place of a nonexistent translation.  If you
+understand other languages, you can set up a priority list of languages.
+This is done through a different environment variable, called
+`LANGUAGE'.  GNU `gettext' gives preference to `LANGUAGE' over `LANG'
+for the purpose of message handling, but you still need to have `LANG'
+set to the primary language; this is required by other parts of the
+system libraries.  For example, some Swedish users who would rather
+read translations in German than English for when Swedish is not
+available, set `LANGUAGE' to `sv:de' while leaving `LANG' to `sv_SE'.
+
+   Special advice for Norwegian users: The language code for Norwegian
+bokma*l changed from `no' to `nb' recently (in 2003).  During the
+transition period, while some message catalogs for this language are
+installed under `nb' and some older ones under `no', it's recommended
+for Norwegian users to set `LANGUAGE' to `nb:no' so that both newer and
+older translations are used.
+
+   In the `LANGUAGE' environment variable, but not in the `LANG'
+environment variable, `LL_CC' combinations can be abbreviated as `LL'
+to denote the language's main dialect.  For example, `de' is equivalent
+to `de_DE' (German as spoken in Germany), and `pt' to `pt_PT'
+(Portuguese as spoken in Portugal) in this context.
+
+1.4 Translating Teams
+=====================
+
+For the Free Translation Project to be a success, we need interested
+people who like their own language and write it well, and who are also
+able to synergize with other translators speaking the same language.
+Each translation team has its own mailing list.  The up-to-date list of
+teams can be found at the Free Translation Project's homepage,
+`<A HREF="http://translationproject.org/">http://translationproject.org/</A>', in the &quot;Teams&quot; area.
+
+   If you'd like to volunteer to _work_ at translating messages, you
+should become a member of the translating team for your own language.
+The subscribing address is _not_ the same as the list itself, it has
+`-request' appended.  For example, speakers of Swedish can send a
+message to `<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/haiku-commits">sv-request at li.org</A>', having this message body:
+
+     subscribe
+
+   Keep in mind that team members are expected to participate
+_actively_ in translations, or at solving translational difficulties,
+rather than merely lurking around.  If your team does not exist yet and
+you want to start one, or if you are unsure about what to do or how to
+get started, please write to `<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/haiku-commits">coordinator at translationproject.org</A>' to
+reach the coordinator for all translator teams.
+
+   The English team is special.  It works at improving and uniformizing
+the terminology in use.  Proven linguistic skills are praised more than
+programming skills, here.
+
+1.5 Available Packages
+======================
+
+Languages are not equally supported in all packages.  The following
+matrix shows the current state of internationalization, as of November
+2007.  The matrix shows, in regard of each package, for which languages
+PO files have been submitted to translation coordination, with a
+translation percentage of at least 50%.
