</I>That's a good side effect, we at least have a choice now :-D
There are good arguments on both sides, i hesitated a lot, but for now i 
think that the best option is &quot;copy by default&quot;, even if i think that 
&quot;move by default&quot; could be done right with some work (is it possible to 
have a trustable move?).
Maybe in the future we could have no default at all, by using other 
criterions per volume, as  &quot;being on a different volume&quot; isn't always a 
good reason to decide.

But anyway, whatever the OS thinks is best for you :), the crucial thing 
is the visual indication of what will happen when you release the 
button. So +1 for the mouse cursor overlay.

As for failing moves or other risky ops, in an ideal world, the computer 
would guess that you are doing something risky, and warn you friendly! 
&quot;Hey user! Are you sure you want to _move_ this file to a floppy disk?&quot; 
Dream or nightmare? :-P
Something that could be nice, in some cases, is a paranoid mode that 
does automatic data validation on copy or move (ex for remote volumes or 
writable cd/dvd).

&gt;<i> 2) Copying a folder onto another folder of the same name now merges
</I>&gt;<i> the contents instead of destroying the original. This fixes ticket
</I>&gt;<i> #1420. Still to do: interactive prompting to allow fine grained file
</I>&gt;<i> replacement and skipping in this and other multi-file cases, but 
</I>&gt;<i> I'll open a new enhancement ticket for that.
</I>Excellent, we can remove that from Haiku-tips too! Didn't try yet, but 
we're on the good track. I definitely want to help you with testing (in 
a few days hopefully).
Implementing interactive prompting didn't sound fun to me when i had a 
look a few weeks ago, but we definitely need it for the feature to be 
complete, i hope you'll find the time :-P. IIRC the interactive 
prompting already works well for multi-file selections.
 

Best regards,
Alex
