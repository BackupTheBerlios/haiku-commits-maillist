<PRE>Hi Julun,

And that was the perfect way to go; Stefano reviewed your code and 
checked it in.

Stephan pointed me to some possible problems in the code, and I had a 
look. And while I was at it, I cleaned up some odd things, too - I 
wouldn't even have reported this to you when I would have reviewed your 
code, but it does certainly improve the code quality.
In open source you cannot always wait for someone to fix a problem; it 
might never get done. If you prefer to get involved, that's perfectly 
okay, but you cannot expect this to happen every time.
Don't take it personally; try to be glad someone fixed a problem in 
Haiku, and you didn't need to spend any time on it.

&gt;<i> &gt; IOW we might break existing BeOS applications with this change. We 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; could try and see if this has any actual consequences - if it 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; doesn't 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; we could keep it as is, and just document the changed behaviour.
</I>&gt;<i> So we are lucky that there are not much killer apps out there who 
</I>&gt;<i> will 
</I>&gt;<i> break.   :)
</I>
In a way 8-)

Bye,
   Axel.
