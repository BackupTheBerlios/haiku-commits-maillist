The point is this: As a programmer, you have no influence on the behaviour. 
If you use strings in certain ways, the new code will make use of 
refernces. But if the programm happens to use the strings in different 
threads, then suddenly things can go wrong, while everything was fine on 
BeOS.

&gt;<i> While testing the class in VS i tested it several times with it's leak 
</I>&gt;<i> checker and it didn't report anything, but anyway...
</I>
You checked against the wrong reference count. atomic_add() returns the 
previous value. If a string without any references has a reference count of 
1 (by definition), then you need to free() the data if atomic_add(..., -1) 
== 1. Also, you should not free in case &lt;= 1, since that could result in 
double frees. Although if you have /this/ threading issue, things go wrong 
anyways, that's one of the aspects that Axel means.

Don't get me wrong, the new reference counting is nice and I know more than 
one app that would benefit _greatly_. We just need to find ways to make 
BString behaviorally compatible with BeOS.

One more thing that pops into my mind: atomic_XX() take volatile ints for a 
reason. Will everything work like it is supposed to if one just casts some 
memory buffer offset to vint32?

Best regards,
-Stephan
