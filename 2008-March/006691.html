</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> But BString wasn't thread safe on beos either.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> That's a completely different context. Consider you share one (static) 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> BString in different threads, and then copy them into other strings and 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> work with those.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> In BeOS this is perfectly fine, with the current BString 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> implementation, it might not.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That's why i asked to review and comment on the code at least a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> month ago.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> People just don't have time always. Stefano reviewed the code, back then, I had no time. I think, I even looked at the code, but nowhere deeply enough, and I didn't saw the necessity either, since you said you were running this code since a while and it worked fine, which I am sure it did for the things you tested. Yesterday, I was testing an application on Haiku and observed big memory leaks. The application only works with network, files, BMessages and BStrings pretty much. I know that it does not leak in R5 or ZETA. I observed that while downloading larger files, the memory stayed fixed, so I though it didn't have to do with network buffers or file writing. I wrote to Axel about the (good) behavior of the kernel caches and also about possible leaks in BMessage and BString. Then I looked at BString a little deeper, but I am not very experienced with atomic_add() and so on. While trying to understand it, I also saw a few things I could fix and prepared a patch. I couldn't 
</I>have told you much, because I was learning it myself as I tried to understand what is going on. It would have been very inefficient to come to an understanding, but still tell *you* to do the changes. Then Axel already commited his patch, which improved more things then my patch.

Since i basically spend most of the time windows coding now, i wrote the 
thing under windows and used InterlockedIncrement/Decrement() which behaves 
slightly different and i failed to port it over to our api...

&gt;<i> Anyways, it's just how it went - I certainly didn't mean to bypass you or anything. It's like Axel said, try to view it from the point that the project improved and you didn't have to spend time on it. If you happen to look into an app_server problem or find something wrong in Icon-O-Matic, please go ahead and fix it. I think it is nice to discuss things when you know someone is already working on something. Then it isn't so nice to just commit something, since it might conflict with the other persons un-commited work.
</I>
It is not meant that way that i would always force one to ask me if there is 
something to change in the code. In case of this at least it would take an 
other persons time to get into the code whereas i would know most of what 
i've done.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> To speak a open word on this without any 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> offense, if there is something wrong or needs to be adjusted with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> any code written by me - point me to it and i'm more than willing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to fix it myself.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Certainly, but it's not always most suitable. When I started to investigate, and I am sure this is what happened on Axel's side as well, I wasn't even sure *if* there is something wrong with the code. But while reading through it and trying to understand how it works, if I spot something already that I can improve, it is inefficient to contact another person to do the change instead, while I have the file open in my editor already.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Please don't take any of this as some kind of hint that you would have been incapable of fixing the code yourself. It's really not like that. We are all learning stuff and if you looked at my code I am sure you would find ways to improve it, and if you do, especially if you are investigating a problem, please go ahead and fix it, you don't have to wait for me, I might be busy. If there are deficiencies in any code, I am sure that 95% of the time, it is because the creator had too little time, especially to test in all kinds of circumstances, or was _yet_ inexperienced with the subject. When you visit something the second or third time, you will always find ways to improve things. So it really is never a matter of suggesting incompetence or anything if someone finds ways of improving things in other peoples code. It is really not good to look at it this way. We should always view ourselves as a team and not competition.
</I>
I'm still see Haiku as a team effort and nothing has changed since i started 
to contribute some time and code. And for sure i want stop helping out :)

Regards,
Karsten
