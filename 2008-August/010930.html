</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The purpose of using the *real* driver buffer size (the one requested 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; above 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that code) is to actually block in write(). If you write to the OSS

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; when there is still space left, you won't block, and that will mess up 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; drift calculation. It may be that it works with your particular sound 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hardware, but it certainly gives audible cracks for the C-Media 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hardware I 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; tested with. Are you sure you don't hear cracks this way?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hmm the buffer_size advertized is the size for *one* buffer, I don't see

</I>&gt;<i> Actually sending one single buffer for the entire card buffer size is

</I>
But that's exactly how the code worked before I started digging in. The 
time drift calculation was turned off, because what you propose makes it 
inpredictable. In the end, I did have to smooth it out some more, even with 
the method I introduced. Anyways, the way you have set things up also gave 
a horrible latency, which was not even accounted for, since you based the 
latency calculation on the audio buffer size, and not on the buffer size 
inside OSS. But then the code wrote as many audio buffers into the driver 
buffer until it blocked, which makes the latency really as long as the 
driver buffer, not the individual audio buffer. By making the driver buffer 
as small as possible and the audio buffer size the same, thereby blocking 
after writing the first buffer, the latency as well as time drift 
calculations start to become more reliable. During the course of trying to 
get it working without any clicks and/or distortions, I have tried a lof of 
things, like writing new data at just the right time before OSS finished 
playing the already written part. But the trouble was that the true 
playback pointer had some kind of drift of it's own, and all the sudden one 
would have to write two buffers at once to catch up. Letting write() block 
turned out to be the only way and is the recommended way in the OSS 
documentation anyways. But doing it like you did with a smaller audio 
buffer and just keeping to write() until you do block, is just incorrect, 
since you don't account for the additional driver buffer size anywhere else 
in the code, and as I said, it gives the same big latency as using a large 
audio buffer the same size as the driver buffer in the first place.

Best regards,
-Stephan
