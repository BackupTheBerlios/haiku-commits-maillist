+						Haiku swap file support
+
+This article describes how to use swap file in Haiku and how the swap system 
+works. 
+
+1.  How to use a swap file?
+
+	Like BeOS, Haiku uses &quot;/var/swap&quot; as default swap file. It is created 
+during the boot process and its size is twice the size of physical memory by 
+default. You can change its size through the VirtualMemory preference 
+application and your settings will take effect after restarting the system.
+	
+	The default swap file &quot;/var/swap&quot; may not satisfy your need. Haiku allows 
+adding/removing a swap file dynamically. (This is *NOT* implemented yet, since
+I do not know how to add bin commands &quot;swapon&quot; and &quot;swapoff&quot; in the system. 
+It needs to be done in the future.)
+
+2.  How swap system works?
+	
+	The virtual memory subsystem of Haiku is very similar to that of FreeBSD,
+therefore our swap system implementation is borrowed from FreeBSD.
+	
+	A swap system has two main functions: (1) maintain a map between anonymous
+pages and swap space, so we can page in/out when needed. (2) manage the 
+allocation/deallocation of swap space. Let's see how these are implemented in
+Haiku.
+
+	In order to maintain a map between pages and swap space, we need to record
+the pages' swap address somewhere. Here we use swap blocks. A &quot;swap_block&quot;
+structure contains swap address information for 32 (value of SWAP_BLOCK_PAGES) 
+consecutive pages from a same cache. So whenever we look for a page in swap 
+files, we should get the swap block for it. But how to get the swap block? 
+Here we use hash table. All swap blocks in the system are arranged into a global
+hash table. The hash table uses a cache's address and page index in this cache 
+as hash key.
+
+	Here is an example.	Suppose a page has been paged out to swap space and now 
+its cache wants to page it in. It works as follows: look up the swap hash table 
+using address of the cache and page index as hash key, if successful, we get 
+the swap block containing the this page's swap address. Then search the swap 
+block to get the exact swap address of this page. After that, we can read the 
+page from swap file using vfs functions.
+	
+	I draw a picture and hope it could help you understand the above words. If
+the pic becomes a mess on your computer, please set the tab width of your text
+editor to 4.

+
+
+	The swap system also manages allocation/deallocation of swap space.	In our
+implementation, each swap file is divided into page-sized slots(called &quot;swap 
+pages&quot;) and a swap file can be seen as an array of many swap pages(see the 
+above picture). Swap page is the unit for swap space allocation/deallocation 
+and we use swap page index (slot index) as swap space address instead of offset.
+All the swap pages in the system are given a unified address and we leave one 
+page gap between two swap files. (e.g. there are 3 swap files in the system, 
+each has 100 swap pages, the address range(to be exact, page index) for each 
+swap file is: 0-99, 101-200, 202-301) Why leave a page gap between swap files?
+Because in this way, we can easily tell if two adjacent pages are in a same 
+swap file. (See the code in VMAnonymousCache::Read()).
+
+	Each swap file has a linear bitmap, and all pages in the swap file are 
+associated with a bit in the bitmap. When the page is used, the corresponding 
+bit is set to 1 and when free, it is set to 0. The linear bitmap is different 
+from FreeBSD. FreeBSD uses a radix bitmap and it's more efficient than linear 
+bitmap especially when swap space is fragmented. The reason why I did not use 
+a radix bitmap is I do not get a total understanding of radix tree structure 
+currently. But I will replace the linear bitmap with radix bitmap in the 
+future.
+
+	Swap space allocation takes place when we swap anonymous pages out.
+In order to make the allocation less probable to fail, anonymous cache will
+reserve swap space when it is initialized. If there is not enough swap space
+left, physical memory will be reserved. Swap space deallocation happens when
+available swap space is low. The page daemon will scan a number of pages and
+if the scanned page has swap space assigned, its swap space will be freed.
+
+3.  Acknowledgement
+	
+	Special thanks to my mentor Ingo. He is a knowledged person and always
+gives me encouragement. Without his consistent and illuminating instructions,
+this project would not have reached its present status.
