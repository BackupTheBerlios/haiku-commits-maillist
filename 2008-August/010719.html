</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don't think the VFS/VM locking is to blame here. At least I can't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; see how
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to change it to avoid this problem. What could help is a different
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; locking/transaction model in the BFS implementation. Changes in a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; transaction
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; could be invisible to others until committed. I.e. in this case the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; file's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; size would be changed, but a reader could still access the file at
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the same
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> While this might help, I don't really see how we can make this a
</I>&gt;<i> requirement for file system implementations. Furthermore, the file
</I>&gt;<i> cache itself needs to be transaction aware as well in the future, and
</I>&gt;<i> this wouldn't really simplify the matter.
</I>&gt;<i> The only actual problem is the page writer, of course, as this one
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't go through the file system to write a page, but its cache
</I>&gt;<i> directly. Therefore, it locks the cache first, and the file system must
</I>&gt;<i> still be able to perform additional locking to prevent changes to the
</I>&gt;<i> disk structure.
</I>
Actually the page writer doesn't have the cache lock when it enters the 
file system. It has marked pages busy though, and the file cache waits for 
busy pages. So the outcome would be pretty much the same (i.e. a deadlock), 
if the file_cache_write() were entered with the inode write lock held.

&gt;<i> If BFS could lock the cache when doing changes to the inode, maybe we
</I>&gt;<i> can get around the requirement of any additional locking in the I/O
</I>&gt;<i> functions. Holding the cache lock would then be very similar to holding
</I>&gt;<i> the read lock - it prevents changes unless you have already write
</I>&gt;<i> locked the inode. This would also mean that we provide VMCache methods
</I>&gt;<i> that require the caller to lock the cache.
</I>&gt;<i> Does this sound like a possible solution?
</I>
I don't see how that would work. Since the cache is not locked while doing 
I/O (and I don't think doing that would be a good idea), locking the cache 
while changing the inode will have no further effect.

What could work is to add FS hooks to read lock/unlock the node. The page 
writer could then acquire the node lock before marking the page busy. 
Entering the file cache would thus require the read lock to be held and the 
io() hook wouldn't do any locking anymore. bfs_write() could thus also keep 
the write lock during the whole time, although that has the obvious 
disadvantage that it totally kills parallelism. The page writer wouldn't be 
able to write back any page from a file that is written to. Since the file 
cache might need pages for writing to the file, this could lead to a 
deadlock situation.

&gt;<i> &gt; time and would see the file with the old size. Another writer could
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; also
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; write in parallel, unless it would cause the file to be resized as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; well. I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; don't know how well the BFS structures allow to implement it this way
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; though.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We would need to change the block cache to be able to use a different
</I>&gt;<i> visibility models, but BFS would need to remember the last transaction
</I>&gt;<i> for read access as well.
</I>&gt;<i> When I wrote the block cache and designed its API, I stayed away from
</I>&gt;<i> this, as this would require a lot of changes in BFS in the read path. I
</I>&gt;<i> wanted to review that stuff once the file cache supported transactions
</I>&gt;<i> as well.
</I>&gt;<i> I think it would be best if the block and file caches would support
</I>&gt;<i> different models to be chosen by the file system.
</I>
I'm not convinced that different models will be necessary. A single model 
that works for all file systems would be best IMHO.

Anyway, back to the current situation: Unless I miss something the only 
real problem ATM is that bfs_write() doesn't hold the write lock when the 
transaction is rolled back. This can be easily remedied by re-locking the 
Inode in Inode::WriteAt() after the file_cache_write(). This will at least 
prevent readers from accessing inconsistent blocks. Though they might read 
the not-yet-overwritten garbage at the end of the file during the time the 
node is not write locked. But that can only be avoided by killing all 
parallelism in that situation, or by changing our transaction support so 
that changes done in the transaction won't be visible to others until the 
transaction is committed.

CU, Ingo
