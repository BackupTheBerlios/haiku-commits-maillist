The &quot;System Monitor&quot; widget I have in my KDE task bar actually shows the 
different origins of memory usage (kernel, used, buffers, cached (no idea 
what &quot;buffers&quot; is supposed to be)) in different colors. ProcessController 
could do the same (using a more tasteful coloring, though :-)).

&gt;<i> 2 - I guess the memory allocation mechanism (malloc(), new()) still use

</I>&gt;<i> problem with this is that the user could see that there is enough memory

</I>
To really see how big the allocations are that you can make, the swap space 
would have to be added to the total memory -- e.g. with 128 MB RAM and 16 GB 
swap space one can do huge (non-locked) allocations.

Anyway, the problem really is that the system_info structure only has three 
values ({max,used,cached}_pages), but we have way more numbers that might be 
interesting: Besides the three that currently are returned (the numbers of 
physical RAM pages), there're the memory that has been committed and the one 
that has been committed for caches, the total, committed, and allocated swap 
space, and the number of physical RAM pages for which swap has been 
allocated. Furthermore there are pages of mmap()ed files.

The alternative I see to reporting the physical page numbers in system_info, 
is to report the total amount of virtual memory (i.e. RAM + swap) as 
max_pages and committed memory as used_pages. The meaning of cached_pages is 
a bit weird then, since the file cache doesn't commit memory and the numbers 
can't really be added or compared. As a variation max_pages could be the 
total physical RAM and used_pages the committed memory maxed at the total 
physical RAM (everything beyond could be considered &quot;used swap&quot;). 
cached_pages would have the same problem.

CU, Ingo
