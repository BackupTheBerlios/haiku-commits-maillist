</I>
It ain't a release unless it's released. :-) And I really wasn't thinking 
of branches that are maintained for months, but rather short lived ones 
that are terminated after a few weeks at the latest. That would also be a 
bit of practice for the eventual alpha branch. :-)

&gt;<i> I would actually like to stay away from that for now, though, as what
</I>&gt;<i> we need to find bugs is exposure;
</I>
Yep, I agree with the need for exposure, but I also see people using Haiku 
for &quot;productive&quot; things like porting stuff. Using the latest BFS change 
that will potentially eat hours of porting work might not that desirable in 
such a case.

&gt;<i> actively maintaining more than a
</I>&gt;<i> single branch also means more overhead.
</I>
Since that doesn't really require any development skills, none of the 
currently active developers would need to do anything, if someone else 
wanted to do that.

&gt;<i> Remembering (via mailss or
</I>&gt;<i> tagging) more or less stable releases for demo purposes would be okay,
</I>&gt;<i> but I wouldn't maintain them in a branch yet.
</I>
Well, I'm fine with tags for the time being. A reasonable naming scheme 
would help, plus a file that lists the most important problems of each 
tagged version.

&gt;<i> Time to restart the distribution planning, anyway.
</I>
Yep.

CU, Ingo
