Well, the reason I closed it was that I opened it. The entire bug 
report, including all feedback on it, was provided by myself (except for 
one comment by Salvattore). The problems I was seeing disappeared so 
closing the bug seemed a logical step.

&gt;<i> I know the &quot;modifying code without full understanding&quot; strategy as &quot;chaos 
</I>&gt;<i> programming&quot; and consider it a serious problem in software development, 
</I>&gt;<i> because employed consequently it produces very poor quality code. Which is

</I>
I do understand your point but, as I said, the alternative to not 
commiting the change (which was correct, but incomplete) seemed to be 
worse. If you have a long running Haiku version, you will be surprised 
if you start checking your indexes. The problem was probably more 
obvious to me because I am also downloading emails in Haiku and trying 
to use it as much as I can for real-world tasks as a way to detect bugs 
that should be fixed for the alpha.

&gt;&gt;<i> I am not sure why you are using this tone anyway.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure what's wrong with my tone. I'm merely pointing out a problem. 
</I>&gt;<i> And it's also not the first time this list saw applied chaos programming 
</I>&gt;<i> (feel free not to regard this concerning only you).
</I>
Let's say that the phrase &quot;Oh well, Axel will clean the mess when he is 
back&quot; (or something to that effect, don't remember the exact phrase) 
didn't help with the perception of this just being pointing out a 
problem, as you say.

Anyway, I do not think you are wrong in pointing what you considered to 
be a problem. Just how you did.

&gt;&gt;<i> Axel
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will be away for 2 weeks so I may as well get it figured out before he
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> gets back.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Great!
</I>
Just did. With a long commit message just to please you. :P :)

&gt;&gt;<i> Feel free to revert the change on your local copy. That is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> what is beautiful about open source.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's even more beautiful that one can easily see what others are doing. :-)
</I>
Go tell that to git users. :)
