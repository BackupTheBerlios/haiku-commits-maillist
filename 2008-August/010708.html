While this might help, I don't really see how we can make this a 
requirement for file system implementations. Furthermore, the file 
cache itself needs to be transaction aware as well in the future, and 
this wouldn't really simplify the matter.
The only actual problem is the page writer, of course, as this one 
doesn't go through the file system to write a page, but its cache 
directly. Therefore, it locks the cache first, and the file system must 
still be able to perform additional locking to prevent changes to the 
disk structure.
If BFS could lock the cache when doing changes to the inode, maybe we 
can get around the requirement of any additional locking in the I/O 
functions. Holding the cache lock would then be very similar to holding 
the read lock - it prevents changes unless you have already write 
locked the inode. This would also mean that we provide VMCache methods 
that require the caller to lock the cache.
Does this sound like a possible solution?

&gt;<i> time and would see the file with the old size. Another writer could 
</I>&gt;<i> also 
</I>&gt;<i> write in parallel, unless it would cause the file to be resized as 
</I>&gt;<i> well. I 
</I>&gt;<i> don't know how well the BFS structures allow to implement it this way 
</I>&gt;<i> though.
</I>
We would need to change the block cache to be able to use a different 
visibility models, but BFS would need to remember the last transaction 
for read access as well.
When I wrote the block cache and designed its API, I stayed away from 
this, as this would require a lot of changes in BFS in the read path. I 
wanted to review that stuff once the file cache supported transactions 
as well.
I think it would be best if the block and file caches would support 
different models to be chosen by the file system.

Bye,
   Axel.
