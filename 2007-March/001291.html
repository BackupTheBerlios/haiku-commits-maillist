Did that, just used LookAndFeel as Axel recommended. The problem is not a 
deadlock, but something that looks like an endless loop (as someone 
apparently already guessed, judging from the comment at the second #if 0), 
but actually isn't one. It's just a very precise computation in 
agg::curve3_div::recursive_bezier(). The approximation scale set on the 
object is so big that the recursion always runs to full depth (32 levels), 
each level branching twofold, thus effectively executing the function a few 
billion times per curve.

The reason for the huge approximation scale -- which is set in 
AGGTextRenderer.cpp in line 185 -- is a not so good looking 
fEmbeddedTransformation matrix. In my test m1 was a huge negative value 
(-7.73e+216), leading to the huge scale.

The reason for that being that libbe leaks Transformable::* symbols stemming 
from libicon.a. It contains a Transformable class version that is not 
compatible with that in the app server.

Moving the libicon.a stuff into a harmless namespace (e.g. BPrivate::Icon) 
should help. I guess, it will suffice to adjust the headers (unless there are 
classes declared in the source files, too), i.e. by enclosing the 
declarations in the namespace and adding respective &quot;using&quot; statements at the 
end of the headers.

CU, Ingo
