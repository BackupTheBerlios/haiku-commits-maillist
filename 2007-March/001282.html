OK, nice.

I'll look into it. May take a while till I get to it, though. I'm still 
tracking something else ATM.

Yep, finding real deadlocks with the kernel debugger is quite simple. You 
basically only need the &quot;teams&quot;, &quot;threads&quot;, and &quot;sem&quot; commands. The only 
non-trivial thing is reading userland &quot;sc&quot;s, but knowing the locks in 
question and where they are acquired does usually suffice. Oh, BLocker must 
be hacked to not use benaphore style, otherwise &quot;sem&quot; won't show the 
current lock holder for such a semaphore -- you might not even need this, 
if you know the code well enough and see which thread is blocking at which 
lock.

The kernel debugger is really pretty intuitive to use. Most commands are 
named and take parameters as one would expect it (&quot;help&quot; also helps :-). 
The only thing to keep in mind is that most numbers, although not prefixed 
with &quot;0x&quot;, are printed in hex, but what you enter is decimal, unless you 
prepend &quot;0x&quot;.

&gt;<i> - but maybe it's worth trying out our GDB
</I>&gt;<i> interface.
</I>
In principle that would be nice, but if the app server really freezes (and 
doesn't crash) you'll have a hard time seeing anything. Even't worse, 
starting gdb in the first place will be some task. :-) Telneting into the 
machine would help, if networking works well enough.

CU, Ingo
