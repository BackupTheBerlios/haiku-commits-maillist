+		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
+		       Version 2, June 1991
+
+ Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
+                       59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
+ Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
+ of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
+
+			    Preamble
+
+  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
+freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
+License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
+software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
+General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
+Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
+using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
+the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
+your programs, too.
+
+  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
+price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
+have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
+this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
+if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
+in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
+
+  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
+anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
+These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
+distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
+
+  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
+gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
+you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
+source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
+rights.
+
+  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
+(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
+distribute and/or modify the software.
+
+  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
+that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
+software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
+want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
+that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
+authors' reputations.
+
+  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
+patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
+program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
+program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
+patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
+
+  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
+modification follow.
+
+		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
+   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
+
+  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
+a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
+under the terms of this General Public License.  The &quot;Program&quot;, below,
+refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot;
+means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
+that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
+either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
+language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
+the term &quot;modification&quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.
+
+Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
+covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
+running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
+is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
+Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
+Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
+
+  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
+source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
+conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
+copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
+notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
+and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
+along with the Program.
+
+You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
+you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
+
+  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
+of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
+distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
+above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
+
+    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
+    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
+
+    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
+    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
+    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
+    parties under the terms of this License.
+
+    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
+    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
+    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
+    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
+    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
+    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
+    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
+    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
+    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
+    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
+
+These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
+identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
+and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
+themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
+sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
+distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
+on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
+this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
+entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
+
+Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
+your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
+exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
+collective works based on the Program.
+
+In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
+with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
+a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
+the scope of this License.
+
+  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
+under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
+Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
+
+    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
+    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
+    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
+
+    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
+    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
+    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
+    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
+    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
+    customarily used for software interchange; or,
+
+    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
+    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
+    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
+    received the program in object code or executable form with such
+    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
+
+The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
+making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
+code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
+associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
+control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
+special exception, the source code distributed need not include
+anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
+form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
+operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
+itself accompanies the executable.
+
+If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
+access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
+access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
+distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
+compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
+
+  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
+except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
+otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
+void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
+However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
+this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
+parties remain in full compliance.
+
+  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
+signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
+distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
+prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
+modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
+Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
+all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
+the Program or works based on it.
+
+  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
+Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
+original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
+these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
+restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
+You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
+this License.
+
+  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
+infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
+conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
+otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
+excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
+distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
+License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
+may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
+license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
+all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
+the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
+refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
+
+If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
+any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
+apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
+circumstances.
+
+It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
+patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
+such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
+integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
+implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
+generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
+through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
+system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
+to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
+impose that choice.
+
+This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
+be a consequence of the rest of this License.
+
+  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
+certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
+original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
+may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
+those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
+countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
+the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
+
+  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
+of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
+be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
+address new problems or concerns.
+
+Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
+specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any
+later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions
+either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
+Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
+this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
+Foundation.
+
+  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
+programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
+to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
+Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
+make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
+of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
+of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
+
+			    NO WARRANTY
+
+  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
+FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
+OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
+PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED

+  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
+to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
+convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
+the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

+&lt;title&gt;Exuberant Ctags: Adding support for a new language&lt;/title&gt;
+&lt;/head&gt;
+&lt;body&gt;
+
+&lt;h1&gt;How to Add Support for a New Language to Exuberant Ctags&lt;/h1&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;
+&lt;b&gt;Exuberant Ctags&lt;/b&gt; has been designed to make it very easy to add your own
+custom language parser. As an exercise, let us assume that I want to add
+support for my new language, &lt;em&gt;Swine&lt;/em&gt;, the successor to Perl (i.e. Perl
+before Swine &lt;wince&gt;). This language consists of simple definitions of
+labels in the form &quot;&lt;code&gt;def my_label&lt;/code&gt;&quot;. Let us now examine the various
+ways to do this.
+&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;h2&gt;Operational background&lt;/h2&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;
+As ctags considers each file name, it tries to determine the language of the
+file by applying the following three tests in order: if the file extension has
+been mapped to a language, if the file name matches a shell pattern mapped to
+a language, and finally if the file is executable and its first line specifies
+an interpreter using the Unix-style &quot;#!&quot; specification (if supported on the
+platform). If a language was identified, the file is opened and then the
+appropriate language parser is called to operate on the currently open file.
+The parser parses through the file and whenever it finds some interesting
+token, calls a function to define a tag entry.
+&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;h2&gt;Creating a user-defined language&lt;/h2&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;
+The quickest and easiest way to do this is by defining a new language using
+the program options. In order to have Swine support available every time I
+start ctags, I will place the following lines into the file
+&lt;code&gt;$HOME/.ctags&lt;/code&gt;, which is read in every time ctags starts:
+
+&lt;code&gt;
+&lt;pre&gt;
+  --langdef=swine
+  --langmap=swine:.swn
+  --regex-swine=/^def[ \t]*([a-zA-Z0-9_]+)/\1/d,definition/
+&lt;/pre&gt;
+&lt;/code&gt;
+The first line defines the new language, the second maps a file extension to
+it, and the third defines a regular expression to identify a language
+definition and generate a tag file entry for it.
+&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;h2&gt;Integrating a new language parser&lt;/h2&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;
+Now suppose that I want to truly integrate compiled-in support for Swine into
+ctags. First, I create a new module, &lt;code&gt;swine.c&lt;/code&gt;, and add one
+externally visible function to it, &lt;code&gt;extern parserDefinition
+*SwineParser(void)&lt;/code&gt;, and add its name to the table in
+&lt;code&gt;parsers.h&lt;/code&gt;. The job of this parser definition function is to
+create an instance of the &lt;code&gt;parserDefinition&lt;/code&gt; structure (using
+&lt;code&gt;parserNew()&lt;/code&gt;) and populate it with information defining how files
+of this language are recognized, what kinds of tags it can locate, and the
+function used to invoke the parser on the currently open file.
+&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;
+The structure &lt;code&gt;parserDefinition&lt;/code&gt; allows assignment of the following
+fields:
+
+&lt;code&gt;
+&lt;pre&gt;
+  const char *name;               /* name of language */
+  kindOption *kinds;              /* tag kinds handled by parser */
+  unsigned int kindCount;         /* size of `kinds' list */
+  const char *const *extensions;  /* list of default extensions */
+  const char *const *patterns;    /* list of default file name patterns */
+  parserInitialize initialize;    /* initialization routine, if needed */
+  simpleParser parser;            /* simple parser (common case) */
+  rescanParser parser2;           /* rescanning parser (unusual case) */
+  boolean regex;                  /* is this a regex parser? */
+&lt;/pre&gt;
+&lt;/code&gt;
+&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;
+The &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; field must be set to a non-empty string. Also, unless
+&lt;code&gt;regex&lt;/code&gt; is set true (see below), either &lt;code&gt;parser&lt;/code&gt; or
+&lt;code&gt;parser2&lt;/code&gt; must set to point to a parsing routine which will
+generate the tag entries. All other fields are optional.
+
+&lt;p&gt;
+Now all that is left is to implement the parser. In order to do its job, the
+parser should read the file stream using using one of the two I/O interfaces:
+either the character-oriented &lt;code&gt;fileGetc()&lt;/code&gt;, or the line-oriented
+&lt;code&gt;fileReadLine()&lt;/code&gt;. When using &lt;code&gt;fileGetc()&lt;/code&gt;, the parser
+can put back a character using &lt;code&gt;fileUngetc()&lt;/code&gt;. How our Swine parser
+actually parses the contents of the file is entirely up to the writer of the
+parser--it can be as crude or elegant as desired. You will note a variety of
+examples from the most complex (c.c) to the simplest (make.c).
+&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;
+When the Swine parser identifies an interesting token for which it wants to
+add a tag to the tag file, it should create a &lt;code&gt;tagEntryInfo&lt;/code&gt;
+structure and initialize it by calling &lt;code&gt;initTagEntry()&lt;/code&gt;, which
+initializes defaults and fills information about the current line number and
+the file position of the beginning of the line. After filling in information
+defining the current entry (and possibly overriding the file position or other
+defaults), the parser passes this structure to &lt;code&gt;makeTagEntry()&lt;/code&gt;.
+&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;
+Instead of writing a character-oriented parser, it may be possible to specify
+regular expressions which define the tags. In this case, instead of defining a
+parsing function, &lt;code&gt;SwineParser()&lt;/code&gt;, sets &lt;code&gt;regex&lt;/code&gt; to true,
+and points &lt;code&gt;initialize&lt;/code&gt; to a function which calls
+&lt;code&gt;addTagRegex()&lt;/code&gt; to install the regular expressions which define its
+tags. The regular expressions thus installed are compared against each line 
+of the input file and generate a specified tag when matched. It is usually
+much easier to write a regex-based parser, although they can be slower (one
+parser example was 4 times slower). Whether the speed difference matters to
+you depends upon how much code you have to parse. It is probably a good
+strategy to implement a regex-based parser first, and if it is too slow for
+you, then invest the time and effort to write a character-based parser.
+&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;
+A regex-based parser is inherently line-oriented (i.e. the entire tag must be
+recognizable from looking at a single line) and context-insensitive (i.e the
+generation of the tag is entirely based upon when the regular expression
+matches a single line). However, a regex-based callback mechanism is also
+available, installed via the function &lt;code&gt;addCallbackRegex()&lt;/code&gt;. This
+allows a specified function to be invoked whenever a specific regular
+expression is matched. This allows a character-oriented parser to operate
+based upon context of what happened on a previous line (e.g. the start or end
+of a multi-line comment). Note that regex callbacks are called just before the
+first character of that line can is read via either &lt;code&gt;fileGetc()&lt;/code&gt; or
+using &lt;code&gt;fileGetc()&lt;/code&gt;. The effect of this is that before either of
+these routines return, a callback routine may be invoked because the line
+matched a regex callback. A callback function to be installed is defined by
+these types:
+
+&lt;code&gt;
+&lt;pre&gt;
+  typedef void (*regexCallback) (const char *line, const regexMatch *matches, unsigned int count);
+
+  typedef struct {
+      size_t start;   /* character index in line where match starts */
+      size_t length;  /* length of match */
+  } regexMatch;
+&lt;/pre&gt;
+&lt;/code&gt;
+&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;
+The callback function is passed the line matching the regular expression and
+an array of &lt;code&gt;count&lt;/code&gt; structures defining the subexpression matches
+of the regular expression, starting from \0 (the entire line).
+&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;
+Lastly, be sure to add your the name of the file containing your parser (e.g.
+swine.c) to the macro &lt;code&gt;SOURCES&lt;/code&gt; in the file &lt;code&gt;source.mak&lt;/code&gt;
+and an entry for the object file to the macro &lt;code&gt;OBJECTS&lt;/code&gt; in the same
+file, so that your new module will be compiled into the program.
+&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;
+This is all there is to it. All other details are specific to the parser and
+how it wants to do its job. There are some support functions which can take
+care of some commonly needed parsing tasks, such as keyword table lookups (see
+keyword.c), which you can make use of if desired (examples of its use can be
+found in c.c, eiffel.c, and fortran.c). Almost everything is already taken care
+of automatically for you by the infrastructure.  Writing the actual parsing
+algorithm is the hardest part, but is not constrained by any need to conform
+to anything in ctags other than that mentioned above.
+&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;
+There are several different approaches used in the parsers inside &lt;b&gt;Exuberant
+Ctags&lt;/b&gt; and you can browse through these as examples of how to go about
+creating your own.
+&lt;/p&gt;
+
+&lt;h2&gt;Examples&lt;/h2&gt;
+
+&lt;p&gt;
+Below you will find several example parsers demonstrating most of the
+facilities available. These include three alternative implementations
+of a Swine parser, which generate tags for lines beginning with
+&quot;&lt;CODE&gt;def&lt;/CODE&gt;&quot; followed by some name.

+
+  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
+1.  Why do you call it &quot;Exuberant Ctags&quot;?
+
+Because one of the meanings of the word &quot;exuberant&quot; is:
+
+    exuberant : produced in extreme abundance : PLENTIFUL syn see PROFUSE
+
+Compare the tag file produced by Exuberant Ctags with that produced by any
+other ctags and you will see how appropriate the name is.
+
+  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
+2.  Why doesn't my editor work with these tag files?
+
+3.  What are these strange bits of text beginning with ;&quot; which follow
+    many of the lines in the tag file?
+
+These are &quot;extension flags&quot;. They are added in order to provide extra
+information about the tag that may be utilized by the editor in order to
+more intelligently handle tags. They are appended to the EX command part of
+the tag line in a manner that provides backwards compatibility with existing
+implementations of the Vi editor. The semicolon is an EX command separator
+and the double quote begins an EX comment. Thus, the extension flags appear
+as an EX comment and should be ignored by the editor when it processes the
+EX command.
+
+Some non-vi editors, however, implement only the bare minimum of EX commands
+in order to process the search command or line number in the third field of
+the tag file. If you encounter this problem, use the option &quot;--format=1&quot; to
+generate a tag file without these extensions (remember that you can set the
+CTAGS environment variable to any default arguments you wish to supply). Then
+ask the supplier of your editor to implement handling of this feature of EX
+commands.
+
+  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
+4.  Why doesn't XEmacs' Speedbar module work with Exuberant Ctags?
+
+The default command line switches used by XEmacs for &quot;etags&quot; are not
+compatible with Exuberant Ctags options. By default, Exuberant Ctags installs
+a symbolic link, &quot;etags&quot;, pointing to the ctags executable. When Exuberant
+Ctags is started with the name &quot;etags&quot;, it produces Emacs-style tag files by
+default.
+
+To fix this, add the following lines to your .emacs file, replacing the path
+to &quot;etags&quot; with the path where the symbolic link was installed.
+
+(autoload 'speedbar &quot;speedbar&quot;)
+(setq speedbar-fetch-etags-command &quot;/usr/local/bin/etags&quot;
+      speedbar-fetch-etags-arguments '(&quot;-f&quot; &quot;-&quot;))

+5.  Why doesn't Xemacs correctly locate the tag in the source file?
+
+This has been observed with version 20.3. It seems that when Xemacs searches
+for a tag, it searches using the tag name instead of the search string located
+in the TAGS file. This is a bug in Xemacs and does not occur in the GNU
+version of Emacs.
+
+  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
+6.  Why doesn't NEdit correctly locate the tag in the source file?
+
+Versions of NEdit prior to 5.1 did not support the extended tag file format
+generated by Exuberant Ctags by default. Either upgrade to version 5.1 or
+specify the option &quot;--format=1&quot; when running ctags to output the old tag file
+format.
+
+  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
+7.  Why can't I jump to &quot;class::member&quot;?
+
+Because, by default, ctags only generates tags for the separate identifiers
+found in the source files. If you specify the --extra=+q option, then
+ctags will also generate a second, class-qualified tag for each class member
+(data and function/method) in the form class::member for C++, and in the form
+class.method for Eiffel and Java.
+
+  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
+8.  How can I avoid having to specify my favorite option every time?
+
+Either by setting the environment variable CTAGS to your custom
+options, or putting them into a .ctags file in your home directory.
+
+  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
+9.  Why do I end up on the wrong line when I jump to a tag?
+
+By default, ctags encodes the line number in the file where macro (#define)
+tags are found. This was done to remain compatible with the original UNIX
+version of ctags. If you change the file containing the tag without
+rebuilding the tag file, the location of tag in the tag file may no longer
+match the current location.
+
+In order to avoid this problem, you can specify the option &quot;--excmd=p&quot;,
+which causes ctags to use a search pattern to locate macro tags. I have
+never uncovered the reason why the original UNIX ctags used line numbers
+exclusively for macro tags, but have so far resisted changing the default
+behaviour of Exuberant Ctags to behave differently.
+
+  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
+10.  How do I jump to the tag I want instead of the wrong one by the
+     same name?
+
+A tag file is simple a list of tag names and where to find them. If there
+are duplicate entries, you often end up going to the wrong one because the
+tag file is sorted and your editor locates the first one in the tag file.
+
+Standard Vi provides no facilities to alter this behavior. However, Vim
+has some nice features to minimize this problem, primarly by examining all
+matches and choosing the best one under the circumstances. Vim also provides
+commands which allow for selection of the desired matching tag.
+
+  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
+11.  What is &quot;Vim&quot;?
+
+Vim is a vi-compatible editor available as source and compilable for any
+platform. Yeah, I know the first reaction is to shy away from this. But you
+will never regret getting it, and you will become greatly attached to its
+features, which you can learn gradually. I would be willing to say that it
+is the best vi-clone available within 4 light-years of Alpha Centauri. It
+works (nearly) exactly like standard vi, but provides some incredibly useful
+extensions (some of which I have participated in designing with the author).
+Most Linux distributions have adopted Vim as its standard vi.
+
+  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
+12.  How can I locate all references to a specific function or variable?
+
+There are several packages already available which provide this capability.
+Namely, these are: GLOBAL source code tag system, GNU id-utils, cscope,
+and cflow. As of this writing, they can be found in the following locations:
+
+GLOBAL:    <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/global">http://www.gnu.org/software/global</A>
+id-utils:  <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/idutils/idutils.html">http://www.gnu.org/software/idutils/idutils.html</A>
+cscope:    <A HREF="http://cscope.sourceforge.net">http://cscope.sourceforge.net</A>
+cflow:     <A HREF="ftp://www.ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/devel/lang/c">ftp://www.ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/devel/lang/c</A>
+
+  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
+13.  Why does appending tags to a tag file tag so long?
+
+Sometimes, in an attempt to build a global tag file for all source files in
+a large source tree of many directories, someone will make an attempt to run
+ctags in append (-a) mode on every directory in the hierarchy. Each time
+ctags is invoked, its default behavior is to sort the tag file once the tags
+for that execution have been added. As the cumulative tag file grows, the sort
+time increases arithmetically.
+
+The best way to avoid this problem (and the most efficient) is to make
+use of the --recurse (or -R) option of ctags by executing the following
+command in the root of the directory hierarchy (thus running ctags only once):
+
+        ctags -R
+
+If you really insist on running ctags separately on each directory, you can
+avoid the sort pass each time by specifying the option &quot;--sort=no&quot;. Once the
+tag file is completely built, use the sort command to manually sort the
+final tag file, or let the final invocation of ctags sort the file.
+
+  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
+14.  How do I get regex support for Win32?
+
+You need to download the GNU regex package for Win32 from the following
+location:
+
+    <A HREF="http://people.delphiforums.com/gjc/gnu_regex.html">http://people.delphiforums.com/gjc/gnu_regex.html</A>
+
+Then point the makefile macro, REGEX_DIR, found in mk_mvc.mak and mk_bc5.mak,
+to the directory created by extracting this archive.
+
+  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
+15.  How should I set up tag files for a multi-level directory hierarchy?
+
+There are a few ways of approaching this:
+
+1.  A local tag file in each directory containing only the tags for source
+    files in that directory.
+
+2.  One single big, global tag file present in the root directory of your
+    hierarchy, containing all tags present in all source files in the
+    hierarchy.
