+\page compatibility Application Level API Incompatibilities with BeOS
+
+\author Ingo Weinhold
+
+Haiku R1 (x86) was designed and is being implemented to be binary and source 
+compatible with applications written for BeOS R5 (x86) to a large extent, but 
+not the other way around. In some cases we deliberately broke source 
+compatibility while at the same time maintaining binary compatibility. Here are
+some specific examples:
+
+- The \c &quot;be&quot; header path is gone - it's called \c &quot;os&quot; in Haiku; since it is 
+  always part of the default header search path anyway, you can always just 
+  remove it to let your software compile on both platforms, ie. replace:
+\code
+#include &lt;be/interface/View.h&gt;
+\endcode
+  with: 
+\code
+#include &lt;interface/View.h&gt;
+\endcode
+  or rather use the preferred method of omitting the first part and use:
+\code
+#include &lt;View.h&gt;
+\endcode
+
+- BeOS contains a deprecated \c add-ons/TrackerAddons.h header, and a 
+  header called \c add-ons/TrackerAddOns.h - Haiku only contains the 
+  latter.
+- Likewise, you'll find \c support/byteorder.h and \c support/ByteOrder.h
+  in BeOS; Haiku only has ByteOrder.h.
+- If you have subclassed BString and if you are using its \c _privateData 
+  member, you might notice that it has been renamed to \link BString::fPrivateData
+  fPrivateData \endlink.  However, it's use is deprecated, and it might even be 
+  made private in the future.
+- The undocumented functions defined in the headers are not implemented.
+- The private Device Map API (used by OpenTracker) has been replaced by a 
+  different API (Disk Device API).
+- The application debugging interface is conceptually similar, but nevertheless
+  source and binary incompatible.
+- The file system API has changed; file systems that worked on BeOS will no 
+  longer work on Haiku.
+- In several places we also dropped compatibility support for older BeOS 
+  versions (PR2, R3, R4), which BeOS R5 still featured.

+\brief A buffered adapter for BPositionIO objects.
+\author Stefano Ceccherini \&lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/haiku-commits">burton666 at freemail.it</A>\&gt;
+
+This class differs from other classes derived from BPositionIO in a sense that
+it does not actually provide an actual entity to be read or written to, but
+rather acts like a &quot;frontend&quot; to a stream. This class especially comes in
+handy when working with files that are constantly written and rewritten and
+where you want do this writing buffered so that the hard disk or the network
+will not have to be accessed so frequently.
+
+This class works as follows. After constructing a BBufferIO object that you
+want to be buffered, you can create this object. The constructor takes a 
+\c stream parameter that points to the object to be buffered. You then use
+this object as a proxy to the resource you want to read of or write to. As
+soon as you use ReadAt(), the buffer will be initialised to the contents
+of the original stream,
+and subsequent calls to the positions within the buffer will not be
+routed to the original stream. In the same way WriteAt() will change
+the data in the buffer, but not in the actual stream. In order to flush
+the changes to the original stream, use the Flush() method. Deleting
+the object when you are done with it will also flush the stream and
+update the original stream.
+
+\note This class is not meant to be used in cases where the 
+original stream requires to be in a consistent state. Neither should this
+class be used as a way to perform 'atomic' writes, because the object 
+might need to do partial writes if it needs to 'move' the buffer. This 
+happens for instance if the original stream is bigger than the buffer.

+\ingroup support

+\brief A BPositionIO derived class that creates a memory buffer.
+
+This class creates a memory buffer and provides a BPositionIO interface to work

+This is especially useful if you want to use a method or function that
+works on an object derived from BPositionIO and you want to do something with
+the resulting data, or it could be useful if you want to read and write to
+memory in a safe way, since this class has boundary checking.
+
+BMallocIO allocates a buffer based on a certain blocksize. This provides a
+mechanism that will prevent it from needing to allocate new memory too often.
+The default blocksize is 256 bytes, you can change it with SetBlockSize(). If you
+are sure you are going to use a bigger buffer, change the blocksize so that
+you won't have to allocate more memory too often, especially if you use this
