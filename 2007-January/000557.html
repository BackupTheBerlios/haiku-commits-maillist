+Notes on the Free Translation Project
+*************************************
+
+   Free software is going international!  The Free Translation Project
+is a way to get maintainers of free software, translators, and users all
+together, so that will gradually become able to speak many languages.
+A few packages already provide translations for their messages.
+
+   If you found this `ABOUT-NLS' file inside a distribution, you may
+assume that the distributed package does use GNU `gettext' internally,
+itself available at your nearest GNU archive site.  But you do _not_
+need to install GNU `gettext' prior to configuring, installing or using
+this package with messages translated.
+
+   Installers will find here some useful hints.  These notes also
+explain how users should proceed for getting the programs to use the
+available translations.  They tell how people wanting to contribute and
+work at translations should contact the appropriate team.
+
+   When reporting bugs in the `intl/' directory or bugs which may be
+related to internationalization, you should tell about the version of
+`gettext' which is used.  The information can be found in the
+`intl/VERSION' file, in internationalized packages.
+
+Quick configuration advice
+==========================
+
+   If you want to exploit the full power of internationalization, you
+should configure it using
+
+     ./configure --with-included-gettext
+
+to force usage of internationalizing routines provided within this
+package, despite the existence of internationalizing capabilities in the
+operating system where this package is being installed.  So far, only
+the `gettext' implementation in the GNU C library version 2 provides as
+many features (such as locale alias, message inheritance, automatic
+charset conversion or plural form handling) as the implementation here.
+It is also not possible to offer this additional functionality on top
+of a `catgets' implementation.  Future versions of GNU `gettext' will
+very likely convey even more functionality.  So it might be a good idea
+to change to GNU `gettext' as soon as possible.
+
+   So you need _not_ provide this option if you are using GNU libc 2 or
+you have installed a recent copy of the GNU gettext package with the
+included `libintl'.
+
+INSTALL Matters
+===============
+
+   Some packages are &quot;localizable&quot; when properly installed; the
+programs they contain can be made to speak your own native language.
+Most such packages use GNU `gettext'.  Other packages have their own
+ways to internationalization, predating GNU `gettext'.
+
+   By default, this package will be installed to allow translation of
+messages.  It will automatically detect whether the system already
+provides the GNU `gettext' functions.  If not, the GNU `gettext' own
+library will be used.  This library is wholly contained within this
+package, usually in the `intl/' subdirectory, so prior installation of
+the GNU `gettext' package is _not_ required.  Installers may use
+special options at configuration time for changing the default
+behaviour.  The commands:
+
+     ./configure --with-included-gettext
+     ./configure --disable-nls
+
+will respectively bypass any pre-existing `gettext' to use the
+internationalizing routines provided within this package, or else,
+_totally_ disable translation of messages.
+
+   When you already have GNU `gettext' installed on your system and run
+configure without an option for your new package, `configure' will
+probably detect the previously built and installed `libintl.a' file and
+will decide to use this.  This might be not what is desirable.  You
+should use the more recent version of the GNU `gettext' library.  I.e.
+if the file `intl/VERSION' shows that the library which comes with this
+package is more recent, you should use
+
+     ./configure --with-included-gettext
+
+to prevent auto-detection.
+
+   The configuration process will not test for the `catgets' function
+and therefore it will not be used.  The reason is that even an
+emulation of `gettext' on top of `catgets' could not provide all the
+extensions of the GNU `gettext' library.
+
+   Internationalized packages have usually many `po/LL.po' files, where
+LL gives an ISO 639 two-letter code identifying the language.  Unless
+translations have been forbidden at `configure' time by using the
+`--disable-nls' switch, all available translations are installed
+together with the package.  However, the environment variable `LINGUAS'
+may be set, prior to configuration, to limit the installed set.
+`LINGUAS' should then contain a space separated list of two-letter
+codes, stating which languages are allowed.
+
+Using This Package
+==================
+
+   As a user, if your language has been installed for this package, you
+only have to set the `LANG' environment variable to the appropriate
+`LL_CC' combination.  Here `LL' is an ISO 639 two-letter language code,
+and `CC' is an ISO 3166 two-letter country code.  For example, let's
+suppose that you speak German and live in Germany.  At the shell
+prompt, merely execute `setenv LANG de_DE' (in `csh'),
+`export LANG; LANG=de_DE' (in `sh') or `export LANG=de_DE' (in `bash').
+This can be done from your `.login' or `.profile' file, once and for
+all.
+
+   You might think that the country code specification is redundant.
+But in fact, some languages have dialects in different countries.  For
+example, `de_AT' is used for Austria, and `pt_BR' for Brazil.  The
+country code serves to distinguish the dialects.
+
+   The locale naming convention of `LL_CC', with `LL' denoting the
+language and `CC' denoting the country, is the one use on systems based
+on GNU libc.  On other systems, some variations of this scheme are
+used, such as `LL' or `LL_CC.ENCODING'.  You can get the list of
+locales supported by your system for your country by running the command
+`locale -a | grep '^LL''.
+
+   Not all programs have translations for all languages.  By default, an
+English message is shown in place of a nonexistent translation.  If you
+understand other languages, you can set up a priority list of languages.
+This is done through a different environment variable, called
+`LANGUAGE'.  GNU `gettext' gives preference to `LANGUAGE' over `LANG'
+for the purpose of message handling, but you still need to have `LANG'
+set to the primary language; this is required by other parts of the
+system libraries.  For example, some Swedish users who would rather
+read translations in German than English for when Swedish is not
+available, set `LANGUAGE' to `sv:de' while leaving `LANG' to `sv_SE'.
+
+   In the `LANGUAGE' environment variable, but not in the `LANG'
+environment variable, `LL_CC' combinations can be abbreviated as `LL'
+to denote the language's main dialect.  For example, `de' is equivalent
+to `de_DE' (German as spoken in Germany), and `pt' to `pt_PT'
+(Portuguese as spoken in Portugal) in this context.
+
+Translating Teams
+=================
+
+   For the Free Translation Project to be a success, we need interested
+people who like their own language and write it well, and who are also
+able to synergize with other translators speaking the same language.
+Each translation team has its own mailing list.  The up-to-date list of
+teams can be found at the Free Translation Project's homepage,
+`<A HREF="http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/contrib/po/HTML/">http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/contrib/po/HTML/</A>', in the &quot;National teams&quot;
+area.
+
+   If you'd like to volunteer to _work_ at translating messages, you
+should become a member of the translating team for your own language.
+The subscribing address is _not_ the same as the list itself, it has
+`-request' appended.  For example, speakers of Swedish can send a
+message to `<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/haiku-commits">sv-request at li.org</A>', having this message body:
+
+     subscribe
+
+   Keep in mind that team members are expected to participate
+_actively_ in translations, or at solving translational difficulties,
+rather than merely lurking around.  If your team does not exist yet and
+you want to start one, or if you are unsure about what to do or how to
+get started, please write to `<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/haiku-commits">translation at iro.umontreal.ca</A>' to reach the
+coordinator for all translator teams.
+
+   The English team is special.  It works at improving and uniformizing
+the terminology in use.  Proven linguistic skill are praised more than
+programming skill, here.
+
+Available Packages
+==================
+
+   Languages are not equally supported in all packages.  The following
+matrix shows the current state of internationalization, as of May 2003.
+The matrix shows, in regard of each package, for which languages PO
+files have been submitted to translation coordination, with a
+translation percentage of at least 50%.

+   Some counters in the preceding matrix are higher than the number of
+visible blocks let us expect.  This is because a few extra PO files are
+used for implementing regional variants of languages, or language
+dialects.
+
+   For a PO file in the matrix above to be effective, the package to
+which it applies should also have been internationalized and
+distributed as such by its maintainer.  There might be an observable
+lag between the mere existence a PO file and its wide availability in a
+distribution.
+
+   If May 2003 seems to be old, you may fetch a more recent copy of
+this `ABOUT-NLS' file on most GNU archive sites.  The most up-to-date
+matrix with full percentage details can be found at

+
+Using `gettext' in new packages
+===============================
+
+   If you are writing a freely available program and want to
+internationalize it you are welcome to use GNU `gettext' in your
+package.  Of course you have to respect the GNU Library General Public
+License which covers the use of the GNU `gettext' library.  This means
+in particular that even non-free programs can use `libintl' as a shared
+library, whereas only free software can use `libintl' as a static
+library or use modified versions of `libintl'.
+
+   Once the sources are changed appropriately and the setup can handle
+the use of `gettext' the only thing missing are the translations.  The
+Free Translation Project is also available for packages which are not
+developed inside the GNU project.  Therefore the information given above
+applies also for every other Free Software Project.  Contact
+`<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/haiku-commits">translation at iro.umontreal.ca</A>' to make the `.pot' files available to
+the translation teams.

+Vern Paxson wrote flex with the help of many ideas and much
+inspiration from Van Jacobson.  Original version by Jef Poskanzer.
+
+The fast table representation is a partial implementation of a design
+done by Van Jacobson.  The implementation was done by Kevin Gong and
+Vern Paxson.
+
+In 2001, W. L. Estes took over as maintainer of flex.
+
+John Millaway is a co-author of the current version of flex. He has
+contributed a large number of new features, fixed a large number of
+outstanding bugs and has made significant contributions to the flex
+documentation.

-This is a generic INSTALL file for utilities distributions.
-If this package does not come with, e.g., installable documentation or
-data files, please ignore the references to them below.
+Copyright (C) 1994, 1995, 1996, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002 Free Software
+Foundation, Inc.
 
-To compile this package:
+   This file is free documentation; the Free Software Foundation gives
+unlimited permission to copy, distribute and modify it.
 
-1.  Configure the package for your system.  In the directory that this
-file is in, type `./configure'.  If you're using `csh' on an old
-version of System V, you might need to type `sh configure' instead to
-prevent `csh' from trying to execute `configure' itself.
+Basic Installation
+==================
 
-The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for
-various system-dependent variables used during compilation, and
-creates the Makefile(s) (one in each subdirectory of the source
-directory).  In some packages it creates a C header file containing
-system-dependent definitions.  It also creates a file `config.status'
-that you can run in the future to recreate the current configuration.
+   These are generic installation instructions.
 
-Running `configure' takes a minute or two.  While it is running, it
-prints some messages that tell what it is doing.  If you don't want to
-see the messages, run `configure' with its standard output redirected
-to `/dev/null'; for example, `./configure &gt;/dev/null'.
+   The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for
+various system-dependent variables used during compilation.  It uses
+those values to create a `Makefile' in each directory of the package.
+It may also create one or more `.h' files containing system-dependent
+definitions.  Finally, it creates a shell script `config.status' that
+you can run in the future to recreate the current configuration, and a
+file `config.log' containing compiler output (useful mainly for
+debugging `configure').
 
-To compile the package in a different directory from the one
-containing the source code, you must use a version of `make' that
-supports the VPATH variable, such as GNU `make'.  `cd' to the directory
-where you want the object files and executables to go and run
-`configure'.  `configure' automatically checks for the source code in
-the directory that `configure' is in and in `..'.  If for some reason
-`configure' is not in the source code directory that you are
-configuring, then it will report that it can't find the source code.
-In that case, run `configure' with the option `--srcdir=DIR', where
-DIR is the directory that contains the source code.
+   It can also use an optional file (typically called `config.cache'
+and enabled with `--cache-file=config.cache' or simply `-C') that saves
+the results of its tests to speed up reconfiguring.  (Caching is
+disabled by default to prevent problems with accidental use of stale
+cache files.)
 
-By default, `make install' will install the package's files in
-/usr/local/bin, /usr/local/lib, /usr/local/man, etc.  You can specify
-an installation prefix other than /usr/local by giving `configure' the
-option `--prefix=PATH'.  Alternately, you can do so by giving a value
-for the `prefix' variable when you run `make', e.g.,
-	make prefix=/usr/gnu
+   If you need to do unusual things to compile the package, please try
+to figure out how `configure' could check whether to do them, and mail
+diffs or instructions to the address given in the `README' so they can
+be considered for the next release.  If you are using the cache, and at
+some point `config.cache' contains results you don't want to keep, you
+may remove or edit it.
 
-You can specify separate installation prefixes for
-architecture-specific files and architecture-independent files.  If
-you give `configure' the option `--exec-prefix=PATH' or set the
-`make' variable `exec_prefix' to PATH, the package will use PATH as
-the prefix for installing programs and libraries.  Data files and
-documentation will still use the regular prefix.  Normally, all files
-are installed using the regular prefix.
+   The file `configure.ac' (or `configure.in') is used to create
+`configure' by a program called `autoconf'.  You only need
+`configure.ac' if you want to change it or regenerate `configure' using
+a newer version of `autoconf'.
 
-Another `configure' option is useful mainly in `Makefile' rules for
-updating `config.status' and `Makefile'.  The `--no-create' option
-figures out the configuration for your system and records it in
-`config.status', without actually configuring the package (creating
-`Makefile's and perhaps a configuration header file).  Later, you can
-run `./config.status' to actually configure the package.  You can also
-give `config.status' the `--recheck' option, which makes it re-run
-`configure' with the same arguments you used before.  This option is
-useful if you change `configure'.
+The simplest way to compile this package is:
 
-Some packages pay attention to `--with-PACKAGE' options to `configure',
-where PACKAGE is something like `gnu-libc' or `x' (for X windows).
-The README should mention any --with- options that the package recognizes.
+  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
+     `./configure' to configure the package for your system.  If you're
+     using `csh' on an old version of System V, you might need to type
+     `sh ./configure' instead to prevent `csh' from trying to execute
+     `configure' itself.
 
-`configure' ignores any other arguments that you give it.
+     Running `configure' takes awhile.  While running, it prints some
+     messages telling which features it is checking for.
 
-If your system requires unusual options for compilation or linking
-that `configure' doesn't know about, you can give `configure' initial
-values for some variables by setting them in the environment.  In
