<PRE>&gt;<i> Why? Unless this is just not functional in Haiku, there is a very 
</I>&gt;<i> real
</I>&gt;<i> and legitimate reason this existed. Most 'normal' users - which is
</I>&gt;<i> what you appear to be trying to warp the interface for - only have 
</I>&gt;<i> one
</I>&gt;<i> BFS partition. This setting turned on means that if they put in a BFS
</I>&gt;<i> CD, such as a disc for a commercial application, it can place an
</I>&gt;<i> Installer icon on the desktop, or similar.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Its far, far more likely to be a problem for developers than any
</I>&gt;<i> hypothetical 'normal' users we'll be getting in the future, but 
</I>&gt;<i> anyone
</I>&gt;<i> who's irritated -knows how to turn it off-.
</I>Please don't think that this was a rash decision, first of all. I 
discussed it with the other Haiku developers, and it was decided as a 
group that the checkbox could be removed. First of all, it is obscure 
and almost without exception not used. The only instances that I'm 
aware of it even being used are on the R5 Pro CD and (I think) the Gobe 
Productive 2.0 CD. There may be a few more, but these are the only ones 
I know of. To be honest, I was not able to figure out why it was there 
in the first place, so thank you for clearing that up for me. :-)It 
isn't even enabled by default, making it even less used -- the only 
people who will enable it are those who know what it's for. For these 
two reasons, it is an edge case function -- one which falls into the 
category &quot;but the user might need to do *this*&quot; Note that the actual 
functionality for this has not been removed, just the checkbox, and 
those irritated by not having it on can pretty safely be assumed to 
both know what the implications of having it on happen to be and to 
know how to turn it on. It's not like it's an option that you will 
commonly have to change, either. :-)
