</I>Users aren't dumb, nor am I implying that they are. They just want to 
get work done with as few hinderances as possible. Also, there are only 
2 different places I've ever heard the term used: image processing and 
in discussions of TV format (16:9 vs 4:3). I've never heard of it used 
for paper size or anything else you've mentioned.

</I>The GIMP isn't the only app to do that, but I think that would be an 
excellent idea.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> IMO &quot;aspect ratio&quot; is the only option to choose.
</I>I can't be used as an example of what other users should be expected to 
do in this case. I, too, am a developer. I figured it out based on my 
computer expertise that I had at that point along with context. I took a 
quick survey around work today with people of varying levels of computer 
expertise. *None* of them knew what aspect ratio was. None. These are 
people with bachelor's and master's degrees. They're not stupid. Their 
expertise is in other fields. If I were to ask someone to sing in a 
choir I was directing, I wouldn't make them learn words like 
counterpoint, hemiola, or basso continuo before they could come to 
rehearsal. Those terms aren't needed so long as the basic skills, such 
as note reading, are there. The same thing goes for computer use. The 
user needs to have basic skills (&quot;hunt &amp; peck typing&quot;, knowing  what a 
mouse is for, where the power button is, etc). I'm not advocating making 
Haiku a kiddie OS, but the bar needs to be set lower than you might 
think. All of us obviously have a passion for computers, and it sets us 
apart -- our level of expertise reflects that passion.

Also, who, would all of you say is our target audience? Other 
developers? Hardly. This is an app which everyone will end up using 
unless they decide that there is a third party app which does a better 
job that the user goes out of there way to download and install. We need 
to keep that in mind. It is possible to describe features in everyday 
language and it should be used for apps which target such a broad 
audience. I'll be the first to admit I haven't hit the mark the first 
time on a number of occasions when it comes to balancing simple vs 
technical, but I'm willing to work to find a way to make things simple 
for regular people without annoying the rest of us much, if at all. And 
I would definitely not call something like this 'idiocy', either.
