-Setting Up
-----------
+Building on BeOS
+================
 
-The build system uses Jam/MR (<A HREF="http://www.perforce.com/jam/jam.html">http://www.perforce.com/jam/jam.html</A>).
-A BeOS executable of Jam 2.5 is available at:
+For building on BeOS you need the development tools from:
 
-  <A HREF="http://haiku-os.org/downloads.php?mode=download&amp;id=10&amp;mirror=0">http://haiku-os.org/downloads.php?mode=download&amp;id=10&amp;mirror=0</A>
+  <A HREF="http://haiku-os.org/downloads">http://haiku-os.org/downloads</A>
 
-Unzip the executable and copy it to /boot/home/config/bin.
-The Jam source code is also included in the source tree. You can as well cd
-into &quot;src/tools/jam&quot; and run &quot;make&quot; to obtain an executable.
+Please always use the most recent versions. They are required to build Haiku.
 
-To build Haiku you also need Oliver Tappe's GCC 2.95.3. You can get it at BeBits:
 
-  <A HREF="http://www.bebits.com/app/4011">http://www.bebits.com/app/4011</A>
+Building on a non-BeOS platform
+===============================
 
-Older versions of GCC 2.95.3 will likely not work.
+Please read the file 'ReadMe.cross-compile' before continuing.
 
-If you intend to build Haiku from a supported build platform other than BeOS,
-e.g. GNU/Linux, you need to build a jam executable yourself (don't use the
-one coming with your distribution). cd into the &quot;src/tools/jam&quot; subdirectory
-of the Haiku tree and type &quot;make&quot; (or &quot;gmake&quot;). The generated jam executable
-will be found in a platform specific subdirectory, e.g. &quot;bin.linuxx86/&quot;.
-The easiest way to use it, is to copy it to a place in your PATH. Furthermore
-you need to build the tools for cross compilation (binutils and gcc). Fear not,
-the configure script will help you with that one; see below.
 
-
 Configuring
------------
+===========
 
-Under BeOS:
+Open a Terminal and change to your Haiku trunk folder. To configure the build
+you can run configure like this:
 
-Open a Terminal and change to your Haiku trunk folder. To configure the build you
-can run configure like this:
+  ./configure --target=TARGET
 
-  $ ./configure --target=TARGET
+Where &quot;TARGET&quot; is the target platform that the compiled code should run on:
+  * haiku (default)
+  * r5
+  * bone
+  * dano (also for Zeta)
 
-Where &quot;TARGET&quot; is the target platform for the build. Valid targets are &quot;r5&quot;,
-&quot;bone&quot;, &quot;dano&quot; and &quot;haiku&quot;. If you omit the target it defaults to &quot;haiku&quot;. To
-configure for ZETA use the &quot;dano&quot; target.
+When building on Linux and other non-BeOS platforms &quot;haiku&quot; is the
+only supported target platform, so you don't need the &quot;--target&quot; parameter.
 
 The configure script generates a file named &quot;BuildConfig&quot; in the &quot;build&quot;
-directory. As long as configure is not modified (!), there is no need to call it
-again. That is for re-building you only need to invoke jam (see below).

+it again. That is for re-building you only need to invoke jam (see below).
 If you don't update the source tree very frequently, you may want to execute
-configure after each update just to be on the safe side.

-Under Linux or another supported build platform:
+Building
+========
 
-You don't need to supply the &quot;--target&quot; option to configure, since the only
-supported target is the default &quot;haiku&quot; anyway. But you have to tell, what
-cross compilation tools to use. The tools installed in the system won't work
-for compiling Haiku itself (they will be used for building some build tools,
-though). The easiest way is to instruct configure to build those tools from the
-sources. Supposing you have checked out the buildutils module from the Haiku
-SVN repository alongside the Haiku source tree, you can do that via:
+Haiku can be built in either of two ways, as disk image file (e.g. for use
+with emulators) or as installation in a directory.
 
-  $ ./configure --build-cross-tools ../buildtools
+Image File
+----------
 
-One of the last output lines should tell you that the tools have been built
-successfully.
+  jam -q haiku-image
 
-Note, that the old gcc 2.95.3 will be used for building Haiku, required for
-binary compatibility with BeOS R5. If you're not interested in binary
-compatibility (or want to build for the PowerPC architecture), you can instead
-use:
+This generates an image file named 'haiku.image' in your output directory
+under 'generated/'.
 
-  $ ./configure --build-cross-tools-gcc4 &lt;arch&gt; ../buildtools
+VMware Image File
+-----------------
 
-Replace &quot;&lt;arch&gt;&quot; with either &quot;x86&quot; or &quot;ppc&quot;, depending on which of the two
-architectures you want to build for.
-[At the moment (2005-12-06) the build for PowerPC, or at least the resulting
-Haiku does not work.]
+  jam -q haiku-vmware-image
 
+This generates an image file named 'haiku.vmdk' in your output
+directory under 'generated/'.
 
+Directory Installation
+----------------------
 
-Building
---------
+  HAIKU_INSTALL_DIR=/Haiku jam -q install-haiku
 
-Haiku can be built in either of two ways, as disk image file (e.g. for use with
-emulators) or as installation in a directory.
+Installs all Haiku components into the volume mounted at &quot;/Haiku&quot; and
+automatically marks it as bootable. To create a partition in the first place
+use DriveSetup and initialize it to BFS.
 
-Image File:
+Note that installing Haiku in a directory only works as expected under BeOS,
+but it is not yet supported under Linux and other non-BeOS platforms.
 
-  $ jam -q haiku-image
+Building Components
+-------------------
 
-Generates an image file named &quot;haiku.image&quot; in your output directory (usually
-&quot;generated/&quot;). This method works for all supported build platforms.
+If you don't want to build the complete Haiku, but only a certain
+app/driver/etc. you can specify it as argument to jam, e.g.:
 
+  jam Pulse
 
-Directory Installation:
+Alternatively, you can 'cd' to the directory of the component you want to
+build and run 'jam' from there.
 
-  $ HAIKU_INSTALL_DIR=/Haiku jam -q install-haiku
+You can also force rebuilding of a component by using the &quot;-a&quot; parameter:
 
-Installs all Haiku components into the directory &quot;/Haiku&quot;. If that directory
-is the root of a mounted BFS partition, you'll have a Haiku partition afterwards.
-To create a partition in the first place use DriveSetup and initialize it to BFS.
+  jam -a Pulse
 
-Note, that installing Haiku in a directory only works as expected under BeOS.

 Running

+=======
 
-Generally there are two ways of running Haiku. On real hardware using a partition
-and on emulated hardware using an emulator like Bochs or QEmu.

+Building on a non-BeOS platform
+===============================
+
+We currently support these non-BeOS platforms:
+ * Linux
+ * FreeBSD
+
+To build Haiku on a non-BeOS platform you must first check out and build the
+cross-compiler. The easiest method for doing so is to check it out in a
+directory just below that of the Haiku root. Navigate to the parent directory
+of Haiku and use a command such as:
+
+  svn checkout <A HREF="svn://svn.berlios.de/haiku/buildtools/trunk">svn://svn.berlios.de/haiku/buildtools/trunk</A> buildtools
+
+You should now have a 'buildtools' folder that contains folders named
+'binutils' and 'gcc' among others.
+
+
+Building Jam
+============
+
+Change to the buildtools folder and we will start to build 'jam' which is a
+requirement for building Haiku. Run the following commands to generate and
+install the tool:
+
+  cd  buildtools/jam  
+  make
+  sudo ./jam0 install
+
+
+Building binutils
+=================
+
+The binutils used by Haiku will be automatically generated according to the
+initial configuration of the Haiku source and placed in the
+'generated/cross-tools' directory of Haiku. Before generating the tools you
+must consider the version required, there are essentially two choices:
+
+  * 2.95: Creates BeOS compatible binaries
+  * 4.x: Incompatible with BeOS, but theoretically more efficient binaries
+
+Unless there is a pressing need, choose 2.95 as the latter option can cause
+frequent build issues. The commands for configuration are,
+
+GCC 2.95
+--------
+
+  cd haiku 
+  ./configure --build-cross-tools ../buildtools/
+
+GCC 4.x
+-------
+
+  cd haiku
+  ./configure --build-cross-tools-gcc4 x86 ../buildtools/
+
+The process can take quite some time, but when it finishes you are ready to
+compile your first Haiku image.
+
+Instructions on how to build Haiku can be found in the 'ReadMe' document.
