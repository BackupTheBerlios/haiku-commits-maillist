Yep, it is mostly liklelly a bug in our resource compiler. Before 
changing the order of the resources, I would get corrupt version and 
description (short and long) and no icon would be attached as 
attributes (with standard bitmap icons not even as a resource. Vector 
icons are correctly added as resources). I would look into this myself 
but I am a bit of a hurry to get this working correctly so I went the 
easiest way (as it also does not have any side-effects).
