Amen. I'm getting sick of constantly getting beaten for anything that
aims at making computers easier to use. Of course, I (we?) don't
always get it right the first time, but this is where you can help us
and point out flaws in our &quot;theories&quot;. We're always thankful for a
nice hint. Our discussions often sound like nitpicking, but in the end
these &quot;minor&quot; issues sum up and really make the difference. I think
that people who want to improve usability should not be disrespected
(sometimes nearly offended!) like they currently are by some of our
developers.

You can help us stay realistic, but please be more open (remember our
philosophy?) and consider that not everyone has your level of
technical knowledge. Am I asking for too much?

Bye,
Waldemar Kornewald
