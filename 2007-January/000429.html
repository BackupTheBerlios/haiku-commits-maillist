This -is- turned on by default in R5. And having the functionality but no 
way to turn it on, or indeed off if your settings had that and you updated, 
is about as useful as a chocolate teapot.

Changing the interface significantly from BeOS - which stripping options is 
- only serves to be counter-intuitive. Its also breaking years-old 
functionality which is relied on by applications that certainly aren't 
going to be recompilable/repackaged for Haiku - more than just GP2 uses 
this.
