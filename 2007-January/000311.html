I wouldn't even regard aspect ratio as a technical term, especially,

That reminds me of those interrogations of the &quot;c't magazin&quot; a German 
TV show. They often ask around what a specific (computer) term means 
and then explain it afterwards.
Anyway, this must be some American thing, &quot;aspect ratio&quot; is even the 
1:1 translation of the (only possible, non-technical) German term 
&quot;Seitenverh&#228;ltnis&quot; used for this - which you could also translate to 
&quot;relation of sides&quot;, or even &quot;proportion of sides&quot;. It's neither a 
foreign word nor a technical term, it's just plain English. I'm pretty 
sure I learned that term in school, even though I had an American 
teacher ;-)

It surprises me that none of your colleagues know this term, but you 
should even be able to derive its meaning when hearing the words, 
though.

But anyway, if you're targetting the ignorant folks, then &quot;Keep 
Proportions&quot; would probably do it as well - it's just slightly more 
confusing for those who know. My view of the English language is of 
course a non-native one, but I would never had gotten the idea that 
&quot;aspect ratio&quot; is even a technical term for anybody.

In this case, I think the lock symbol is the way to go; it's often used 
for this, and would also make a good example (to copy) in our sources.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for regular people without annoying the rest of us much, if at all.

The way you are pursuing this, you will constantly be beaten for this 
in the future, too, sorry.
It's okay to try to make things simpler, but it always depends on how 
you'll do it.
Most of the time, it makes more sense to keep the focus on the actual 
problems, and not those you made up. From my point of view, I waste a 
serious amount of time with bloated discussions like these.

&gt;<i> You can help us stay realistic, but please be more open (remember our
</I>&gt;<i> philosophy?) and consider that not everyone has your level of
</I>&gt;<i> technical knowledge. Am I asking for too much?
</I>
Most of the time, yes. At least I can foresee I won't always have the 
patience to talk you out of some stupid ideas, and the way you insist 
on them.
For example, a bug tracker is a tool for *developers*, not end-users. 
They only should be able to easily enter a bug report (and scan the 
existing ones). If any usability feature is going in the way of the 
target audience, it's misplaced and should be removed.

Bye,
   Axel.
