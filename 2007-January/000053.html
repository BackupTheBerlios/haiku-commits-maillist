+7:30, Channel 5: The Bionic Dog (Action/Adventure)
+	The Bionic Dog drinks too much and kicks over the National Redwood Forest.
+
+7:30, Channel 8: The Bionic Dog (Action/Adventure)
+	The Bionic Dog gets a hormonal short-circuit and violates the Mann Act with an interstate Greyhound bus.
+%
+A &quot;critic&quot; is a man who creates nothing and thereby feels qualified to judge the work of creative men. There is logic in this; he is unbiased -- he hates all creative people equally.
+%
+A celebrity is a person who is known for his well-knownness.
+%
+	A circus foreman was making the rounds inspecting the big top when a scrawny little man entered the tent and walked up to him.  &quot;Are you the foreman around here?&quot; he asked timidly.  &quot;I'd like to join your circus; I have what I think is a pretty good act.&quot;
+	The foreman nodded assent, whereupon the little man hurried over to the main pole and rapidly climbed up to the very tip-top of the big top. Drawing a deep breath, he hurled himself off into the air and began flapping his arms furiously.  Amazingly, rather than plummeting to his death the little man began to fly all around the poles, lines, trapezes and other obstacles,
+performing astounding feats of aerobatics which ended in a long power dive from the top of the tent, pulling up into a gentle feet-first landing beside the foreman, who had been nonchalantly watching the whole time.
+	&quot;Well,&quot; puffed the little man.  &quot;What do you think?&quot;
+	&quot;That's all you do?&quot; answered the foreman scornfully.  &quot;Bird imitations?&quot;
+%
+A critic is a bundle of biases held loosely together by a sense of taste.
+		-- Whitney Balliett
+%
+A diva who specializes in risque arias is an off-coloratura soprano.
+%
+A drama critic is a person who surprises a playwright by informing him what he meant.
+		-- Wilson Mizner
+%
+A fool-proof method for sculpting an elephant: first, get a huge block of marble; then you chip away everything that doesn't look like an elephant.
+%
+	A hard-luck actor who appeared in one coloossal disaster after another finally got a break, a broken leg to be exact.  Someone pointed out that it's the first time the poor fellow's been in the same cast for more than a week.
+%
+A Hollywood producer calls a friend, another producer on the phone.
+	&quot;Hello?&quot; his friend answers.
+	&quot;Hi!&quot; says the man.  &quot;This is Bob, how are you doing?&quot;
+	&quot;Oh,&quot; says the friend, &quot;I'm doing great!  I just sold a screenplay for two hundred thousand dollars.  I've started a novel adaptation and the studio advanced me fifty thousand dollars on it.  I also have a television series coming on next week, and everyone says it's going to be a big hit! I'm doing *great*!  How are you?&quot;
+	&quot;Okay,&quot; says the producer, &quot;give me a call when he leaves.&quot;
+%
+A man paints with his brains and not with his hands.
+%
+	A musical reviewer admitted he always praised the first show of a new theatrical season.  &quot;Who am I to stone the first cast?&quot;
+%
+	A musician of more ambition than talent composed an elegy at the death of composer Edward MacDowell.  She played the elegy for the pianist Josef Hoffman, then asked his opinion.  &quot;Well, it's quite nice,&quot; he replied, but don't you think it would be better if...&quot;
+	&quot;If what?&quot; asked the composer.
+	&quot;If ... if you had died and MacDowell had written the elegy?&quot;
+%
+A poet who reads his verse in public may have other nasty habits.
+%
+A rose is a rose is a rose.  Just ask Jean Marsh, known to millions of PBS viewers in the '70s as Rose, the maid on the BBC export &quot;Upstairs, Downstairs.&quot;  Though Marsh has since gone on to other projects, ... it's with Rose she's forever identified.  So much so that she even likes to joke about having one named after her, a distinction not without its drawbacks.  &quot;I was very flattered when I heard about it, but when I looked up the official description, it said, `Jean Marsh: pale peach, not very good in beds; better up against a wall.'  I want to tell you that's not true.  I'm very good in beds as well.&quot;
+%
+A sequel is an admission that you've been reduced to imitating yourself.
+		-- Don Marquis
+%
+	A shy teenage boy finally worked up the nerve to give a gift to Madonna, a young puppy.  It hitched its waggin' to a star.
+%
+A team effort is a lot of people doing what I say.
+		-- Michael Winner, British film director
+%
+A true artist will let his wife starve, his children go barefoot, his mother drudge for his living at seventy, sooner than work at anything but his art.
+		-- Shaw
+%
+A writer is congenitally unable to tell the truth and that is why we call what he writes fiction.
+		-- William Faulkner
+%
+A yawn is a silent shout.
+		-- G.K. Chesterton
+%
+A young man wrote to Mozart and said:
+
+Q: &quot;Herr Mozart, I am thinking of writing symphonies. Can you give me any suggestions as to how to get started?&quot;
+A: &quot;A symphony is a very complex musical form, perhaps you should begin with some simple lieder and work your way up to a symphony.&quot;
+Q: &quot;But Herr Mozart, you were writing symphonies when you were 8 years old.&quot;
+A: &quot;But I never asked anybody how.&quot;

+Actors will happen even in the best-regulated families.
+%
+Actresses will happen in the best regulated families.
+		-- Addison Mizner and Oliver Herford, &quot;The Entirely
+		New Cynic's Calendar&quot;, 1905
+%
+Adding sound to movies would be like putting lipstick on the Venus de Milo.
+		-- actress Mary Pickford, 1925
+%
+Adhere to your own act, and congratulate yourself if you have done something strange and extravagant, and broken the monotony of a decorous age.
+		-- Ralph Waldo Emerson
+%
+After a few boring years, socially meaningful rock 'n' roll died out. It was replaced by disco, which offers no guidance to any form of life more advanced than the lichen family.
+		-- Dave Barry, &quot;Kids Today: They Don't Know Dum Diddly Do&quot;
+%
+Alex Haley was adopted!
+%
+All art is but imitation of nature.
+		-- Lucius Annaeus Seneca
+%
+An actor's a guy who if you ain't talkin' about him, ain't listening.
+		-- Marlon Brando
+%
+An artist should be fit for the best society and keep out of it.
+%
+Another possible source of guidance for teenagers is television, but television's message has always been that the need for truth, wisdom and world peace pales by comparison with the need for a toothpaste that offers whiter teeth *and* fresher breath.
+		-- Dave Barry, &quot;Kids Today: They Don't Know Dum Diddly Do&quot;
+%
+Any dramatic series the producers want us to take seriously as a representation of contemporary reality cannot be taken seriously as a representation of anything -- except a show to be ignored by anyone capable of sitting upright in a chair and chewing gum simultaneously.
+		-- Richard Schickel
+%
+Any fool can paint a picture, but it takes a wise person to be able to sell it.
+%
+	&quot;Are you police officers?&quot;
+	&quot;No, ma'am.  We're musicians.&quot;
+		-- The Blues Brothers
+%
+Around the turn of this century, a composer named Camille Saint-Saens wrote a satirical zoological-fantasy called &quot;Le Carnaval des Animaux.&quot;  Aside from one movement of this piece, &quot;The Swan&quot;, Saint-Saens didn't allow this work to be published or even performed until a year had elapsed after his death. (He died in 1921.)
+	Most of us know the &quot;Swan&quot; movement rather well, with its smooth, flowing cello melody against a calm background; but I've been having this fantasy...
+	What if he had written this piece with lyrics, as a song to be sung? And, further, what if he had accompanied this song with a musical saw?  (This instrument really does exist, often played by percussionists!)  Then the piece would be better known as:
+	SAINT-SAENS' SAW SONG &quot;SWAN&quot;!
+%
+Art is a jealous mistress.
+		-- Ralph Waldo Emerson
+%
+Art is a lie which makes us realize the truth.
+		-- Picasso
+%
+Art is anything you can get away with.
+		-- Marshall McLuhan.
+%
+Art is either plagiarism or revolution.
+		-- Paul Gauguin
+%
+Art is Nature speeded up and God slowed down.
+		-- Chazal
+%
+Art is the tree of life.  Science is the tree of death.
+%
+As a goatherd learns his trade by goat, so a writer learns his trade by wrote.
+%
+Asking a working writer what he thinks about critics is like asking a lamp-post how it feels about dogs.
+		-- Christopher Hampton
+%
+Authors (and perhaps columnists) eventually rise to the top of whatever depths they were once able to plumb.
+		-- Stanley Kaufman
+%
+Authors are easy to get on with -- if you're fond of children.
+		-- Michael Joseph, &quot;Observer&quot;
+%
+Bahdges?  We don't need no stinkin' bahdges!
+		-- &quot;The Treasure of Sierra Madre&quot;
+%
+Be regular and orderly in your life, so that you may be violent and original in your work.
+		-- Flaubert
+%
+Being a mime means never having to say you're sorry.
+%
+&quot;Being disintegrated makes me ve-ry an-gry!&quot; &lt;huff, huff&gt;
+%
+Ben, why didn't you tell me?
+		-- Luke Skywalker
+%
+&quot;Benson, you are so free of the ravages of intelligence&quot;
+		-- Time Bandits
+%
+Best Mistakes In Films
+	In his &quot;Filmgoer's Companion&quot;, Mr. Leslie Halliwell helpfully lists four of the cinema's greatest moments which you should get to see if at all possible.
+	In &quot;Carmen Jones&quot;, the camera tracks with Dorothy Dandridge down a street; and the entire film crew is reflected in the shop window.
+	In &quot;The Wrong Box&quot;, the roofs of Victorian London are emblazoned with television aerials.
+	In &quot;Decameron Nights&quot;, Louis Jourdain stands on the deck of his fourteenth century pirate ship; and a white lorry trundles down the hill in the background.
+	In &quot;Viking Queen&quot;, set in the times of Boadicea, a wrist watch is clearly visible on one of the leading characters.
+		-- Stephen Pile, &quot;The Book of Heroic Failures&quot;
+%
+BS:	You remind me of a man.
+B:	What man?
+BS:	The man with the power.
+B:	What power?
+BS:	The power of voodoo.
+B:	Voodoo?
+BS:	You do.
+B:	Do what?
+BS:	Remind me of a man.
+B:	What man?
+BS:	The man with the power...
+		-- Cary Grant, &quot;The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer&quot;
+%
+Burnt Sienna.  That's the best thing that ever happened to Crayolas.
+		-- Ken Weaver
+%
+But if you wish at once to do nothing and to be respectable nowdays, the best pretext is to be at work on some profound study.
+		-- Leslie Stephen, &quot;Sketches from Cambridge&quot;
+%
+But you shall not escape my iambics.
+		-- Gaius Valerius Catullus
+%
+Can't act.  Slightly bald.  Also dances.
+		-- RKO executive, reacting to Fred Astaire's screen test.

+%
+Darth Vader sleeps with a Teddywookie.
+%
+Darth Vader!  Only you would be so bold!
+		-- Princess Leia Organa

+Did you know that the voice tapes easily identify the Russian pilot that shot down the Korean jet?  At one point he definitely states:

+		-- The Doctor, &quot;Doctor Who&quot;
+%
+Fools rush in -- and get the best seats in the house.
+%
+For myself, I can only say that I am astonished and somewhat terrified at the results of this evening's experiments.  Astonished at the wonderful power you have developed, and terrified at the thought that so much hideous and bad music may be put on record forever.

+FORTUNE DISCUSSES THE OBSCURE FILMS: #12
+
+O.E.D.:				David Lean, 1969, 3 hours 30 min.
+
+	Lean's version of the Oxford Dictionary has been accused of
+	shallowness in its treatment of a complete work.  Omar Sharif
+	tends to overact as aardvark, but Alec Guiness is solid in
+	the role of abbacy.  As usual, the photography is stunning.
+	With Julie Christie.

+
+MIRACLE ON 42ND STREET:
+	Santa Claus, in the off season, follows his heart's desire and tries to make it big on Broadway.  Santa sings and dances his way into your heart.
+%
+FORTUNE DISCUSSES THE OBSCURE FILMS: #5
+
+THE ATOMIC GRANDMOTHER:
+	This humorous but heart-warming story tells of an elderly woman forced to work at a nuclear power plant in order to help the family make ends meet.  At night, granny sits on the porch, tells tales of her colorful past, and the family uses her to cook barbecues and to power small electrical appliances.  Maureen Stapleton gives a glowing performance.
+%
+FORTUNE DISCUSSES THE OBSCURE FILMS: #9
+
+THE PARKING PROBLEM IN PARIS:	Jean-Luc Godard, 1971, 7 hours 18 min.
+
+	Godard's meditation on the topic has been described as everything from &quot;timeless&quot; to &quot;endless.&quot;  (Remade by Gene Wilder as NO PLACE TO PARK.)

+G. B. Shaw to William Douglas Home: &quot;Go on writing plays, my boy.  One of these days a London producer will go into his office and say to his secretary, `Is there a play from Shaw this morning?' and when she says `No,' he will say, `Well, then we'll have to start on the rubbish.' And that's your chance, my boy.&quot;
+%
+Gauls! We have nothing to fear; except perhaps that the sky may fall on our heads tomorrow.  But as we all know, tomorrow never comes!!
+		-- Adventures of Asterix
+%
+George Bernard Shaw once sent two tickets to the opening night of one of his plays to Winston Churchill with the following note: 
+	&quot;Bring a friend, if you have one.&quot;
+
+Churchill wrote back, returning the two tickets and excused himself as he had a previous engagement.  He also attached the following:
+	&quot;Please send me two tickets for the next night, if there is one.&quot;
+%
+Go ahead... make my day.

+%
+God help the troubadour who tries to be a star.  The more that you try to find success, the more that you will fail.

+Hoaars-Faisse Gallery presents:
+An exhibit of works by the artist known only as Pretzel.
+
+The exhibit includes several large conceptual works using non-traditional media and found objects including old sofa-beds, used mace canisters, discarded sanitary napkins and parts of freeways.  The artist explores our dehumanization due to high technology and unresponsive governmental structures in a post-industrial world.  She/he (the artist prefers to remain without gender) strives to create dialogue between viewer and creator, to aid us in our quest to experience contemporary life with its inner-city tensions, homelessness, global warming and gender and class-based stress.  The works are arranged to lead us to the essence of the argument: that the alienation of the person/machine boundary has sapped the strength of our voices and must be destroyed for society to
+exist in a more fundamental sense.

+I accept chaos.  I am not sure whether it accepts me.  I know some people are terrified of the bomb.  But then some people are terrified to be seen carrying a modern screen magazine.  Experience teaches us that silence terrifies people the most.

+%
+I didn't like the play, but I saw it under adverse conditions.  The curtain was up.
+%
+I distrust a close-mouthed man.  He generally picks the wrong time to talk and says the wrong things.  Talking's something you can't do judiciously, unless you keep in practice.  Now, sir, we'll talk if you like.  I'll tell you right out, I'm a man who likes talking to a man who likes to talk.
+		-- Sidney Greenstreet, &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot;
+%
+I don't know anything about music.  In my line you don't have to.
+		-- Elvis Presley
+%
+I dread success.  To have succeeded is to have finished one's business on earth, like the male spider, who is killed by the female the moment he has succeeded in his courtship.  I like a state of continual becoming, with a goal in front and not behind.
+		-- George Bernard Shaw
+%
+I had another dream the other day about music critics.  They were small and rodent-like with padlocked ears, as if they had stepped out of a painting by Goya.

My friend said Virgil Thomson.&quot;  I asked him, &quot;What do you say?&quot; He replied, &quot;I say Aaron Copeland.&quot; I said, &quot;You're right.&quot;  The porter said,  &quot;I knew Thomson doesn't write counterpoint that way.&quot;  I told that to a network president, and he was deeply unimpressed.

+ II. Any body in motion will tend to remain in motion until solid matter intervenes suddenly.
+	Whether shot from a cannon or in hot pursuit on foot, cartoon

+	Sir Isaac Newton called this sudden termination of motion the

+III. Any body passing through solid matter will leave a perforation conforming to its perimeter.
+	Also called the silhouette of passage, this phenomenon is the
+	speciality of victims of directed-pressure explosions and of reckless

+	the wall of a house, leaving a cookie-cutout-perfect hole.  The

+IV. The time required for an object to fall twenty stories is greater than or equal to the time it takes for whoever knocked it off the ledge to spiral down twenty flights to attempt to capture it unbroken.

+ V. All principles of gravity are negated by fear.
+	Psychic forces are sufficient in most bodies for a shock to propel

+	character's head may be glimpsed emerging from the cloud of
+	altercation at several places simultaneously.  This effect is common
+	as well among bodies that are spinning or being throttled.  A &quot;wacky&quot;

What is it, girl?&quot;, etc., as if this had never happened before, instead of every week.  What with all the time these people spent pinned under the tractor, I don't see how they managed to grow any crops whatsoever.

First we checked to make sure the amplifier would fit through the frame, using the belt from my bathrobe to measure, then we picked up the amplifier and backed up to my bedroom door.

Definitely not for the squeamish, or those on diets that are driving them crazy.
+
+	FRIDAY THE 13TH DINER II,III,IV,V,VI: Much, much more of the same. Except with sour cream.

+	THE TATERNATOR: Cyborg spud returns from the future to present-day McDonald's restaurant to kill the potatoess (girl 'tater) who will give birth to the world's largest french fry (The Dark Powers of Burger King are clearly behind this).  Most quotable line: &quot;Ah'll be baked...&quot;
+
+	A FISTFUL OF FRIES: Western in which our hero, The Spud with No Name, rides into a town that's deprived of carbohydrates thanks to the evil takeover
+of the low-cal Scallopinni Brothers.  Plenty of smokeouts, fry-em-ups, and general butter-melting by all.
+
+	FOR A FEW FRIES MORE: Takes up where AFOF left off!  Cameo by Walter Cronkite, as every man's common 'tater!

+Producers seem to be so prejudiced against actors who've had no training. And there's no reason for it.  So what if I didn't attend the Royal Academy for twelve years?  I'm still a professional trying to be the best actress I can.  Why doesn't anyone send me the scripts that Faye Dunaway gets?

+Recently deceased blues guitarist Stevie Ray Vaughan &quot;comes to&quot; after his death.  He sees Jimi Hendrix sitting next to him, tuning his guitar. &quot;Holy cow,&quot; he thinks to himself, &quot;this guy is my idol.&quot;  Over at the microphone, about to sing, are Jim Morrison and Janis Joplin, and the bassist is the late Barry Oakley of the Allman Brothers.  So Stevie Ray's thinking, &quot;Oh, wow!  I've died and gone to rock and roll heaven.&quot; Just then, Karen Carpenter walks in, sits down at the drums, and says:
+&quot;'Close to You'.  Hit it, boys!&quot;

+Snow White has become a camera buff.  She spends hours and hours shooting pictures of the seven dwarfs and their antics.  Then she mails the exposed film to a cut rate photo service.  It takes weeks for the developed film to arrive in the mail, but that is all right with Snow White.  She clears the table, washes the dishes and sweeps the floor, all the while singing &quot;Someday my prints will come.&quot;

+So do the noble fall.  For they are ever caught in a trap of their own making. A trap -- walled by duty, and locked by reality.  Against the greater force they must fall -- for, against that force they fight because of duty, because of obligations.  And when the noble fall, the base remain.  The base -- whose only purpose is the corruption of what the noble did protect.  Whose only purpose is to destroy.  The noble: who, even when fallen, retain a vestige of strength.  For theirs is a strength born of things other than mere force. Theirs is a strength supreme... theirs is the strength -- to restore.

+	So Richard and I decided to try to catch [the small shark]. With a great deal of strategy and effort and shouting, we managed to maneuver the shark, over the course of about a half-hour, to a sort of corner of the lagoon, so that it had no way to escape other than to flop up onto the land and evolve.  Richard and I were inching toward it, sort of crouched over, when all of a sudden it turned around and -- I can still remember the sensation I felt at that moment, primarily in the armpit area -- headed right straight toward us.
+	Many people would have panicked at this point.  But Richard and I were not &quot;many people.&quot;  We were experienced waders, and we kept our heads.  We did exactly what the textbook says you should do when you're unarmed and a shark that is nearly two feet long turns on you in water up to your lower calves: We sprinted I would say 600 yards in the opposite direction, using a sprinting style such that the bottoms of our feet never once went below the surface of the water.  We ran all the way to the far shore, and if we had been in a Warner Brothers cartoon we would have run right INTO the beach, and you would have seen these two mounds of sand racing across the island until they bonked into trees and coconuts fell onto their heads.

+Star Wars is adolescent nonsense; Close Encounters is obscurantist drivel; Star Trek can turn your brains to puree of bat guano; and the greatest science fiction series of all time is Doctor Who!  And I'll take you all on, one-by-one or all in a bunch to back it up!
