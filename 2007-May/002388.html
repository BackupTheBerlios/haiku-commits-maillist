   In some performance critical code there might come a time where you

   The principle is easy. The constructor takes the number of blocks you
   want to create beforehand, the size of the blocks and the method of
   allocation. This can either be #B_OBJECT_CACHE or #B_MALLOC_CACHE.
-  The first uses C++ operators \c new[] and \c delete[], the second uses
-  \c malloc() and \c free(). Unless you have specific demands on performance

   As soon as you have the memory pool, you can Get() blocks. If the
