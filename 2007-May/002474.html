+  able to send objects between applications, or even between computers across
   networks.
   
-  BArchivable differs from BFlattenable in way that BFlattenable is designed to
-  store objects to flat streams of data, where the main objective is storing it
-  to disk. The objective of this interface is to archive objects that will be
-  restored as objects. To illustrate that point, BArchivable messages know how

-  Archiving is done with the Archive() method. If your class support it, the
-  caller can request your class to to a deep archivation, which means that all
-  child objects should be stored. Unarchiving works with the Instantiate()
-  method, which is static. However, since the interface is designed to
-  unarchive objects without the caller knowing what kind of object it
-  actually is, the global function #instantiate_object() instantiates a message
-  without you manually having to determine the class the message is from. This
-  adds considerable flexibility and allows BArchivable to be used in
