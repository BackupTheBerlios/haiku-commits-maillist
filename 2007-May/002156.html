  I considered this solution, but would rather not change the driver's
lock a spinlock before asserting fully that the usage of mutexes is
not possible. Besides having a lot of repercussions in the original
driver's source, Haiku should scale well in multi processor
environments. Handling the driver's interrupt handler with interrupts
disabled also leads to other problems, including with the allocation
and freeing of memory.

  What FreeBSD does is handling what it considers &quot;non fast&quot;
interrupts in a dedicated thread. Not saying Haiku should copy of
FreeBSD, I believe it is a good solution as it reduces possible
latency and allows the kernel to schedule the pending work better,
specially if we consider RT. And in this context i tried to mimic what
the driver expects.

&gt;<i> The problem of your solution is that it just doesn't work for shared
</I>&gt;<i> IRQs - and we currently cannot control how IRQs are chosen; we rely on
</I>&gt;<i> the BIOS for this.
</I>&gt;<i> Another problem is that you can easily lose IRQs when you disable them
</I>&gt;<i> that way, though the drivers might already contain code to cope with
</I>&gt;<i> that.
</I>
  I understand the problem, but does this mean the current solution
isn't acceptable?
