   \section formalrequirements Formal Requirements
 
   This section describes formal requirements, such as location and naming of
   the files, the header blocks of files, what blocks of documentation look like
-  and how to put delimeters to separate different 'blocks' in your source file.

   \subsection formalrequirements_location Location of the Documentation Source
   
-  Doxygen, the tool that we use to generate the marked up documentation,
-  has an ingenious parser that is able to scan through both header and source
-  files and that makes it possible to document the API directly in the headers
-  or the source. However, the Haiku project decided not to put the
-  documentation in either location, and opt for the third option Doxygen gives:
-  to put the documentation in separate files.

+  location, and opt for the third option Doxygen provides: to put the

-  \note The reasons to not put the
-    documentation in the header files are twofold. First of all, it would
-    unnecesarily add much cruft to the headers that the compiler will have to
-    parse unneededly. File access and speed isn't BeOS and Haiku's best quality.
-    The second reason is that the system headers are included throughout the
-    tree. It's a waste of electricity to have everybody recompile the entire tree
-    if someone fixes a typo in the documentation. Likewise, the reason to not put
-    the documentation in the source is that it unnecesarily clutters up that
-    source. By not using direct documentation we lose some advantages, like the
-    fact that developers might be inclined to update the documentation quicker
-    if they change a method, but as you will see we'll have some methods in place
-    to prevent that to a certain extend.
