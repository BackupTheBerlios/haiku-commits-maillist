Log:
Work in progress. I'm still working on documenting many of the fs hooks, but I just wanted to commit this to quiet down the amount of warnings that are produced.

+
+  Invoked by the VFS when it has been requested to mount the volume. The FS is

+  back in \a _fs. Moreover it must invoke publish_vnode() for the root node
+  of the volume and pass the ID of the volume back in \a _rootVnodeID.
+
+  A disk-based FS will need to check whether \a device is not \c NULL, open
+  it, and analyze whether the device or image file actually represents a volume
+  of that FS type.

+  If mounting the volume fails for whatever reason, the hook must return an
+  error code other than \c B_OK. In this case all resources allocated by the

+  - \c free_nodes: Number of additional nodes the volume could contain. If
+    there is no such limitation use \c LONGLONG_MAX.
