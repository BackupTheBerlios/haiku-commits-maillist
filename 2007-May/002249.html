<PRE>Hey Axel,

  I love kruft just as much as the next guy. :-) However, i think we
need a realistic stance here. I've seen more than once FreeBSD drivers
considered a &quot;temporary solution&quot; and i think people should detract
from this idea. Although it certainly is a nice target to have all
&quot;native&quot; drivers, i think we should be better off spending our time
making Haiku work and as well as people expect it to be. The amount of
hardware supported is certainly a part of that experience, however, as
long as it works it is really not that important if the drivers are
&quot;native&quot; or &quot;ported&quot;, as long as the end result is a stable and fast
platform.

  Also, considering the current API which hides away the internal
buffer management of the driver, etc, i don't consider this much of a
porting effort but more of a framework that allows freebsd drivers to
be integrated as native. We should not ignore the user base of the
freebsd drivers, which is certainly larger than that of haiku's, and
thus the drivers are more tested and probably more stable as well.
Trying to duplicate that effort, is if you ask me a bit of a waste of
time, but people are free to waste their time as they wish. :-)

  Just some food for thought,
    Hugo
