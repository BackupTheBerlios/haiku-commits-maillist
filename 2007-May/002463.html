Modified:
   haiku/trunk/docs/user/support/BlockCache.dox
Log:
Patch by Thom Holwerda:
&quot;Phase III .diff for BlockCache.dox.

Not much to change here, some really minor things only. The thing
that makes the .diff large is the fact that many lines were more like
70char than 80char.&quot;

   \brief A class that creates and maintains a pool of memory blocks.
 
-  In some performance critical code there might come a time where you
-  require a lot of little blocks of memory that you want to access and
-  dispose of continuously. Since allocating and freeing memory are 
-  'expensive' operations, it's better to have a pool of memory blocks at

   The principle is easy. The constructor takes the number of blocks you

+  one uses \c malloc() and \c free(). Unless you have specific demands on
   performance or you want to take care of freeing the objects yourself, either
   way works fine.
 
   As soon as you have the memory pool, you can Get() blocks. If the
-  pre-allocated memory blocks run out, BBlockCache will allocate
-  new ones, so you will not have to worry about availability. As soon as
-  you are done you can Save() the memory back into the pool. BBlockCache will

-  requested when you created the object, so be aware of that.
