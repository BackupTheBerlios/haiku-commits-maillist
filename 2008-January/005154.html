<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; New Revision: 23177
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Log:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Add a list of installed apps and their copyrights to the credits 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; view, using a query.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I just tried this and took a look at the list. While I find the use 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a query to do this quite cool and elegant, I somehow have concerns 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; about having it where it is now. I would find it most suitable and 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; useful in an installer/package manager style application. Putting 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; into AboutSystem with no filtering somehow looks to me as if 3rd 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; party 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; software was &quot;endorsed&quot; by Haiku even if there is no connection at 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; all. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; On a plain installation it obviously only lists stuff actually 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; brought 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in by Haiku which is not a problem. But on my system here where I 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; put 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; lot of R5 stuff to test, the list somehow does not fit anymore. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; just my opinion though and I don't have strong feelings about it. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; if 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; everyone else has no such concerns it's a non-issue.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Same here, I just wanted to have a look at it before I speak up 
</I>&gt;<i> (still 
</I>&gt;<i> didn't find the time yet).
</I>
Ideally that would also list the libraries and add-ons and avoid having 
to maintain the hardcoded list except for internal code.
Of course that'd would need filtering.
However the app is now named &quot;AboutSystem&quot;, not AboutHaiku anymore, 
which means it gives info about the whole system (and later the 
distro).
So I think it might be the good place for it.
We could filter Haiku stuff first, then list installed apps separately.

But i was really just for testing, might need some work/rewording.

Fran&#231;ois.
