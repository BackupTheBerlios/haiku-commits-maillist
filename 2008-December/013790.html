<PRE>&gt;<i> I have the feeling this direct mode should be dropped 
</I>&gt;<i> completely for the software renderer. 
</I>
We can do this only if we drop single buffer mode too, as did Be Inc ultimatelly.
They added direct mode support omainly to support single buffer mode, nothing more.

&gt;<i> I think it was you who outlined the flaws of the 
</I>&gt;<i> current buffering design. It seemed the conclusion 
</I>&gt;<i> was that there would always be at least one off-screen 
</I>&gt;<i> buffer needed. One for single buffering and more offscreen 
</I>&gt;<i> buffers in the swapping modes. 
</I>
Exact. These were my conclusions.

&gt;<i> So my idea would be to completely 
</I>&gt;<i> drop the direct rendering as it is done now, use DrawBitmap() 
</I>&gt;<i> *always* and in this way let the app_server take care of dithering. 
</I>&gt;<i> That should give a huge speed up for single buffer mode, if that 
</I>&gt;<i> one used the BDirectWindow bits directly before, as it shouldn't 
</I>&gt;<i> do anyways.
</I>
It used to call DrawBitmapAsync() even, in order to return 
to the rendering thread could start the next frame ASAP.

I agree that for a software renderer, direct mode doesn't make any sense 
and, in fact, is counter-productive. Not even speaking of cursor black trail and black hole in screenshots ;-)
I'll return to an always double BBitmaps buffered design, drawn by the app_server, indeed. Meanwhile, using direct mode allowed us to find issues regarding direct_buffer info handling in GLView...

&gt;<i> For an actually hardware accelerated renderer, the situation 
</I>&gt;<i> would be different. But it would not be a problem there anyways, 
</I>&gt;<i> since the dithering would also be done in hardware.
</I>
For HW, the direct mode would provided usefull info for HW clipping and dithering, indeed.
I guess people noticed that AMD released open-sourced 3D DRI and DRM supporting even latest radeon 4k?
After Intel and VIA, maybe it's time for me to dive into this... nightmare of code layers and see if and what could be ported to bring basic HW 3D.

I tried to contact VIA about their new and cheap Chrome PCIe card. Being a lot less complex and powerfull GPU, starting small will have been great. Unfortunatly, it's unavaible outside US and they simply don't answer their emails. None mine, at least :-\.

Bye,
  Philippe.
