I would be in favor of Ingo's suggestion if we changed it so that up to 
a specific number (say, 5 -- or just one if B_NO_POINTER_HISTORY is 
used) messages can be stored in this shared memory.
Then, we would make sure there:
a) is a pointer history for those apps that are fast enough
b) there is a (minimal) pointer history for those apps that aren't fast 
enough (but those could use your new flag, instead)
c) GetMouse() and DispatchMessage() would not need any extra code
d) it doesn't matter how slow the system is, it would always work 
reliable.

Ingo's suggestion has the added advantage that no actual messages are 
sent for each mouse button when it's not needed, so that save some 
cycles.
But that can be done at later point, too.

Bye,
   Axel.
