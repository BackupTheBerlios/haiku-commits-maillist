<PRE>Hi,

Ok.

&gt;<i>c) GetMouse() and DispatchMessage() would not need any extra code
</I>
I am not sure about that, since Ingo's solution works at the BWindow level 
(global), while the no-history-flag works at the view level. So I guess the 
BWindow level code would always have to provide the history and there will 
have to at least be some extra code in GetMouse().

&gt;<i> d) it doesn't matter how slow the system is, it would always work

</I>
The current method does work reliable. It may do too much on a slow system 
as per my TODO comment, which is obviously undesired. But reliable it is.

&gt;<i> Ingo's suggestion has the added advantage that no actual messages are 
</I>&gt;<i> sent for each mouse button when it's not needed, so that save some cycles.
</I>&gt;<i> But that can be done at later point, too.
</I>
To me it looks, like the proposed method would have some benefits, but not 
all the ones you outlined (reduced complexity and added reliability). Since 
the current solution works, I am inclined to be lazy, especially since I 
have some other stuff that interests me currently. Like experimenting with 
subpixel rendering methods or implementing playlist loading/saving in 
MediaPlayer or looping and repeat modes... :-) But someone else, please 
feel free to implement it! :-P

Best regards,
-Stephan
