<PRE>Hi all,

to actually see subpixel rendering in action, the file

	headers/libs/freetype2/freetype/config/ftoption.h

has to define

	#define FT_CONFIG_OPTION_SUBPIXEL_RENDERING

I am hesitant to turn this on in the source, since according to the comment 
above the config option, it would potentially violate patents. Since we are 
distributing images in contries where software patents apply, people may 
have to turn this on individually. Personally, I wouldn't be concerned so 
much, but I am not just turning this on without consensus.

Before you reply, please read this (please really do, it's not that long):

&lt;<A HREF="http://david.freetype.org/cleartype-patents.html">http://david.freetype.org/cleartype-patents.html</A>&gt;


Technically, subpixel rendering means this:
* The realization that you can reliably address individual RGB subpixels of
  an LCD and use this as &quot;three times the horizontal resolution&quot;.
* To render glyphs or other shapes three times the width .(You may guess
  rightfully that that is not very technically challenging.)
* To do something against the resulting color fringes. ClearType applies
  some filtering which technically blurrs the result again, which I
  personally find counterproductive. Currently Andrej's implementation
  does the same, although it special cases triplets of same coverage which
  makes it a bit sharper than ClearType. I have an idea for yet another
  method, but it looks to me like the anti-color-fringes implementation
  is yet the most technically challenging of these three points.

All in all, I have a hard time not finding the ideas behind all this 
trivial. That's of course not meant to discredit the work done by Andrej to 
implement it all, it was a lot of work and changes in many places. But 
technically, it just isn't rocket sience and really boils down to these 
three points I outlined. I simply don't find the patents justified, but 
that's just me. Maybe a lot of neat ideas have a level of simplicity to 
them that could be called elegance. So FMPOV, it boils down to the idea 
itself, which clearly has examples of prior art even mentioned in the 
patents.

Best regards,
-Stephan
