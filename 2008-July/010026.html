<PRE>Hi again

&gt;<i> I don't think there's any difference in this respect. The current 
</I>&gt;<i> implementation uses bins for different allocation sizes, a slab 
</I>&gt;<i> allocator 
</I>&gt;<i> based implementation uses a set of object caches with different 
</I>&gt;<i> object 
</I>&gt;<i> sizes.
</I>
Yes, but that's quite a big difference in fact. One heap_allocator can 
have multiple bins of different sizes. It employs a address -&gt; 
heap_page -&gt; bin translation to directly look up in what page and bin 
an allocation resides. With a set of object caches this is more 
involved, as you have to search through those to find in which one an 
allocation resides, as with a bog standard free() you don't know the 
allocation size. That's in fact the single most problematic thing - not 
knowing the allocation size. There are ways around that by employing a 
boundary tag to store the allocation size, but that is neither safe nor 
space efficient. Especially when doing aligned allocations of 
B_PAGE_SIZE this can get pretty wasteful.

&gt;<i> implementation performs pretty well. In fact I think it's a bit 
</I>&gt;<i> similar to 
</I>&gt;<i> a slab allocator. The latter has a few optimizations (like per-CPU 
</I>&gt;<i> magazines and slab coloring), though, that will probably give it an 
</I>&gt;<i> edge.
</I>
In fact it has become (unintentionally even ;-) mostly the same as a 
slab. It has a cache (heap_allocator), slabs (heap_pages), objects (the 
actual allocations) and depots (heap_area). It does a few optimizations 
by removing the full lists for example (as they are not really needed 
as you can't do anything with a full page/area) and through bins it has 
the above mentioned advantage over a set of individual object_caches. 
This makes it just more fit to the task at hand.

And really adding per-CPU allocators is just a matter of adding a [&lt;
cpuCount&gt;] dimension to sHeaps and taking the current CPU into account 
when choosing the heap to allocate from. Coloring can be done by simply 
rotating the start offset of a bin per page. So I'd rather add those 
two things to the heap than changing the heap to a not exactly fitting 
mechanism.

&gt;<i> I haven't looked closely at our slab allocator implementation, but 
</I>&gt;<i> IIRC it 
</I>&gt;<i> still needs some work (e.g. object depots are disabled). Just in case 
</I>&gt;<i> you're looking for a task... :-P
</I>
I have taken a closer look at our slab and the block_allocator it 
provides, and it just isn't as efficient (space wise, it uses said 
boundary tag). In fact since the heap is so similar to a slab now, you 
could just as well suggest replacing the slab with the heap. By simply 
removing the bins from the heap (making the element size global per 
allocator) and adding constructors/destructors, you'd get a perfectly 
capable slab...

But really in the sense of &quot;the best tool for the job&quot; I think we just 
shouldn't mix both approaches. Each has it's own set of problems and 
mechanism to solve them. Using one for the other would undoubtatly 
work, but why would you use a slab for something that isn't really the 
task of a slab by wrapping around glue code and using extra memory when 
you have a perfectly capable heap that is specifically designed for the 
task and doesn't need either workaround? It's not even like you could 
remove a lot of code, as the heap is pretty compact and self contained.

Regards
Michael
