That depends. From what I have seen so far large heaps tend to be used 
heavily only during boot. Later on the small heap is the most 
frequently used and growing one. So if at all you would want the small 
heap to grow in bigger chunks to avoid creating a long list of small 
heaps. If you grow the large allocation heap with a bigger size you 
would in many cases just allocate a big block that is rarely used. 
Making the grow size dynamic so it can get bigger the more a heap class 
is used would be an idea, but this works against the desire to keep the 
heaps small to make the chance of a heap becoming empty bigger. Not 
that freeing an empty heap was implemented... The currently common grow 
size plus the avarge use pattern seem to be pretty balanced, so I don't 
really think changing grow sizes would bring a real benefit. Keep in 
mind that we grow by 4MB right now and allocations cannot get bigger 
than 1MB at a time (otherwise an area is used) and are usually in the &lt; 
10KB range, so you don't fill those heaps that quickly.

Michael
