Hi Stephan,

its nice that you started working on the slow mouse issues, but I really
don't think your current solution is good.

I think we don't need a B_FULL_POINTER_HISTORY flag. The default mouse
sampling rate is 100 samples per second for PS/2, 40 samples per second 
for serial, and 125 for USB. Those can be increased by the drivers,
up to 200 for ps2 and 1000 for USB.
I don't know what haiku currently is using, we should check this, but 
calling BView::MouseMoved at that rate certainly shouldn't be a problem.

Additionally as Axel already said, your change ignores transitions. I 
think that transitions were completely broken even before your changes, 
I couldn't find out where &quot;be:transit&quot; in the message is ever populated. 
The BeBook BView::MouseMoved describes that the entered view and exit 
view both get a MouseMoved event, this doesn't seem to be implemented, too.

BView::GetMouse() with checkQueue = false is supposed to return the 
current position and button state, how do we do it, can we bypass the
queue and directly get the state from input_server (shared memory?)

The BeBook says:
 &gt; If checkQueue is true, and the view's parent window has pending
 &gt; update events, GetMouse() causes those update events to be processed.

Is this probably our problem? do we need to process any further 
drawing(?) events each time GetMouse is called?

Or another idea: if the problems occur usually inside MouseDown, MouseUp
or MouseMoved. perhaps we should stop inserting events in the queue
while these Hooks are active (waiting with a small timeout, perhaps 5ms)
and drop those mouse events, except if its a view enter/leave transition.

regards
Marcus
