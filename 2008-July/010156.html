<PRE>Hi Marcus,

I understand your concerns, but you have written most of them without a 
good overview of the concerning codebase.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think we don't need a B_FULL_POINTER_HISTORY flag. The default mouse

</I>&gt;<i> I don't know what haiku currently is using, we should check this, but 
</I>&gt;<i> calling BView::MouseMoved at that rate certainly shouldn't be a problem.
</I>
But that's the point, if it isn't a problem, then my solution doesn't 
change anything! In another words, if an application is fast enough to 
handle 1000 messages per second, then my change will not have any effect. 
If it isn't, then my change will remove old mouse messages from the queue. 
The point that Ingo was making is that most applications will not have any 
use for that many mouse messages. I may add that mouse messages are only 
generated when the mouse actually moves, so it's not that the applications 
get constantly flooded with messages. The movement samples may be finer 
than they need to be though and Ingo has presented a solution, but I 
believe it may have other drawbacks (like pretty much no mouse history at 
all). In any case, my change doesn't have anything to do with it as long as 
applications are fast enough to handle it. The change only addresses a 
lagging problem *if* it occurs.

&gt;<i> Additionally as Axel already said, your change ignores transitions.
</I>
That is correct and I will need to fix that. When I first worked on 
BView::GetMouse() the day before, I was still thinking about it, but in my 
last change, I had forgotten it. Will fix that.

&gt;<i> I 
</I>&gt;<i> think that transitions were completely broken even before your changes,
</I>
Why?

&gt;<i> I 
</I>&gt;<i> couldn't find out where &quot;be:transit&quot; in the message is ever populated. 
</I>
But it is, see BWindow::_SanitizeMessage(). It is even more reliable than 
on BeOS the way we (Axel) implemented it. Appearantly, on R5, transit is 
handled by the app_server, but that brings some problems. In Haiku, the 
window keeps track with the fLastMouseMovedView in all situations and uses 
that to pass transit correctly.

&gt;<i> The BeBook BView::MouseMoved describes that the entered view and exit 
</I>&gt;<i> view both get a MouseMoved event, this doesn't seem to be implemented, 
</I>&gt;<i> too.
</I>
But it is. Is it not working?

&gt;<i> BView::GetMouse() with checkQueue = false is supposed to return the 
</I>&gt;<i> current position and button state, how do we do it, can we bypass the 
</I>&gt;<i> queue and directly get the state from input_server (shared memory?)
</I>
Yes we do. If checkQueue = false, we will not even look at the queue but 
send a synchronous message to the app_server and get the absolutely most 
current position. I suppose you have not looked at BView::GetMouse() before 
you wrote this? The problem is that most applications don't pass checkQueue 
= false, which I have pointed out in my first mail to the development list. 
Pe calls GetMouse(checkQueue = true) in a loop that has a snooze(20000) 
inserted. That's got to build up the mouse queue, because mouse messages 
come way faster than at 20000 &#181;s inbetween.

&gt;<i> The BeBook says:
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; If checkQueue is true, and the view's parent window has pending update 
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; events, GetMouse() causes those update events to be processed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is this probably our problem? do we need to process any further 
</I>&gt;<i> drawing(?) events each time GetMouse is called?
</I>
Again, that's handled. Otherwise applications wouldn't update their UI 
anymore because they block in MouseDown(). But that is not the problem, and 
it can be seen when looking at BView::GetMouse().

&gt;<i> Or another idea: if the problems occur usually inside MouseDown, MouseUp 
</I>&gt;<i> or MouseMoved. perhaps we should stop inserting events in the queue while 
</I>&gt;<i> these Hooks are active (waiting with a small timeout, perhaps 5ms) and 
</I>&gt;<i> drop those mouse events, except if its a view enter/leave transition.
</I>
It may make things more complicated than need be. Really, my solution is 
quite simple and only kicks in when necessary. Optionally with the new 
flag, applications can explicitely turn it off. The only problem is that I 
forgot to special case certain transit messages.

Best regards,
-Stephan
