Allocations of over 128KB should be rare. The only case I saw it 
happening was in the slab or more correctly in the OpenHashTable it 
uses that grows it's list considerably when doing large amounts of file 
traffic like checking out the Haiku sources.

About adjusting the initial heap size: I already thought of that and 
did so :-). In my tests the 16MB of initial heap were pretty much ideal 
for a complete boot process. Note that not each heap class get's it's 
own full block of initial heap. The initial heap (16MB) is sliced into 
pieces for the different heap classes. A percentage determines the 
amount each class gets. After some experimenting I assigned 50% = 8MB 
to the small heap, 30% = 4.8MB to the large heap and 20% = 3.2MB to the 
huge heap class. This seems to work out pretty well. Furhter use/
testing will show if we need to fine tune those numbers some more.

Regards
Michael
