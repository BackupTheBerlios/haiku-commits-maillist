Okay, I didn't really think of that. How common are allocations over 
128KB anyway? Maybe we want to adapt the initial heap size to values 
that are actually used, so that as little memory as possible is wasted.
Another strategy would be to lazily allocate the pages of the heap, so 
that they are only actually mapped in when they are used for the first 
time. Dunno if that pays off, though - it depends again on the actual 
heap usage, I guess.

&gt;<i> Making the grow size dynamic so it can get bigger the more a heap 
</I>&gt;<i> class 
</I>&gt;<i> is used would be an idea, but this works against the desire to keep 
</I>&gt;<i> the 
</I>&gt;<i> heaps small to make the chance of a heap becoming empty bigger. Not 
</I>&gt;<i> that freeing an empty heap was implemented... The currently common 
</I>&gt;<i> grow 
</I>&gt;<i> size plus the avarge use pattern seem to be pretty balanced, so I 
</I>&gt;<i> don't 
</I>&gt;<i> really think changing grow sizes would bring a real benefit. Keep in 
</I>&gt;<i> mind that we grow by 4MB right now and allocations cannot get bigger 
</I>&gt;<i> than 1MB at a time (otherwise an area is used) and are usually in the 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt; 
</I>&gt;<i> 10KB range, so you don't fill those heaps that quickly.
</I>
Okay.

Bye,
   Axel.
