</I>&gt;<i> allocation resides, as with a bog standard free() you don't know the
</I>&gt;<i> allocation size. That's in fact the single most problematic thing - not
</I>&gt;<i> knowing the allocation size. There are ways around that by employing a
</I>&gt;<i> boundary tag to store the allocation size, but that is neither safe nor
</I>&gt;<i> space efficient.
</I>
Why would that not be safe? Or do you mean when code overwrites the tags?

&gt;<i> Especially when doing aligned allocations of
</I>&gt;<i> B_PAGE_SIZE this can get pretty wasteful.
</I>
Unless I'm much mistaken that's actually the only memalign() in the kernel 
(in the VM translation map code), and we might want to use a specialized 
allocator for those anyway.

&gt;<i> &gt; implementation performs pretty well. In fact I think it's a bit
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; similar to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a slab allocator. The latter has a few optimizations (like per-CPU
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; magazines and slab coloring), though, that will probably give it an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; edge.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In fact it has become (unintentionally even ;-) mostly the same as a
</I>&gt;<i> slab. It has a cache (heap_allocator), slabs (heap_pages), objects (the
</I>&gt;<i> actual allocations) and depots (heap_area). It does a few optimizations
</I>&gt;<i> by removing the full lists for example (as they are not really needed
</I>&gt;<i> as you can't do anything with a full page/area) and through bins it has
</I>&gt;<i> the above mentioned advantage over a set of individual object_caches.
</I>&gt;<i> This makes it just more fit to the task at hand.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And really adding per-CPU allocators is just a matter of adding a [&lt;
</I>&gt;<i> cpuCount&gt;] dimension to sHeaps and taking the current CPU into account
</I>&gt;<i> when choosing the heap to allocate from. Coloring can be done by simply
</I>&gt;<i> rotating the start offset of a bin per page. So I'd rather add those
</I>&gt;<i> two things to the heap than changing the heap to a not exactly fitting
</I>&gt;<i> mechanism.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I haven't looked closely at our slab allocator implementation, but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; IIRC it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; still needs some work (e.g. object depots are disabled). Just in case
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you're looking for a task... :-P
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have taken a closer look at our slab and the block_allocator it
</I>&gt;<i> provides, and it just isn't as efficient (space wise, it uses said
</I>&gt;<i> boundary tag). In fact since the heap is so similar to a slab now, you
</I>&gt;<i> could just as well suggest replacing the slab with the heap. By simply
</I>&gt;<i> removing the bins from the heap (making the element size global per
</I>&gt;<i> allocator) and adding constructors/destructors, you'd get a perfectly
</I>&gt;<i> capable slab...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But really in the sense of &quot;the best tool for the job&quot; I think we just
</I>&gt;<i> shouldn't mix both approaches. Each has it's own set of problems and
</I>&gt;<i> mechanism to solve them. Using one for the other would undoubtatly
</I>&gt;<i> work, but why would you use a slab for something that isn't really the
</I>&gt;<i> task of a slab by wrapping around glue code and using extra memory when
</I>&gt;<i> you have a perfectly capable heap that is specifically designed for the
</I>&gt;<i> task and doesn't need either workaround?
</I>
Regarding boundary tags, that could be solved differently, e.g. by 
maintaining a page -&gt; object cache map.

&gt;<i> It's not even like you could
</I>&gt;<i> remove a lot of code, as the heap is pretty compact and self contained.
</I>
It's still a few KB of frequently-used code. The same goes for the slab 
allocator. Cutting down the code size should be friendlier to the CPU 
caches at least.

CU, Ingo
