+These are the Release Notes leading-up to Revision 2.4.4 of netperf:
+
+Things changed in this release:
+
+*) The LOC_CPU and REM_CPU tests will report their respective beliefs
+   as to the number of CPUs present when the verbosity is set to more
+   than one.  This can be used when trying to diagnose issues with CPU
+   utilization.
+
+*) A kind soul who wishes to remain anonymous provided a patch to
+   enable use of sendfile() on OSX.
+
+*) Fix a misplaced \n in a format string of send_tcp_maerts, courtesy
+   of Alexander Duyck.
+
+*) There is an experimental global -r option which will allow one to
+   include CPU utilization measurements, but make the decision about
+   hitting confidence based on the result only.  The test banner will
+   reflects this when -r is used.
+
+*) It is no longer necessary to specify a file with the global -F
+   option when running a _SENDFILE test.  Netperf will create a
+   temporary file and populate it with random data and use that.  If
+   running aggregate tests it is strongly suggested one use a -F
+   option. Otherwise, the overhead spent creating and populating the
+   temporary file will be included in the CPU utilization calculation.
+
+*) The configure script recognizes Solaris 11 and selects the correct
+   CPU utilization mechanism - or rather it selects the same mechanism
+   as is used in Solaris 10.  Fix courtesy of Andrew Gallatin.
+
+*) Convert a number of struct sockaddr_in's to struct
+   sockaddr_storage's and add requisite casts to deal with some abort
+   problems on Windows and perhaps other platforms as well. Kudos to
+   Alexander Duyck.
+
+*) One can now pass a value of 'x' to the global -f option to specify
+   the units as transactions per second.  This is the default for any
+   request/response test, which is determined by there being a &quot;double
+   `r'&quot; in the name - eg &quot;RR,&quot; &quot;rr,&quot; &quot;Rr,&quot; or &quot;rR.&quot;  At present only
+   the TCP_RR test actually looks for this to be set.
+
+*) One can request bits/bytes per second as the primary output of a
+   TCP_RR test by setting the global -f option to [kmgKMG] as with any
+   of the &quot;STREAM&quot; tests.  This converts the primary throughput metric
+   to a bitrate (byterate) following the verbosity rules for a STREAM
+   test.  Service demand remains usec/Transaction regardless of the
+   setting of the global -f option.
+
+   A verbosity level of 2 or more will cause the TCP_RR test to report
+   calculated average RTT latency, transaction rate, and inbound and
+   outbound transfer rates regardless of the primary units selected
+   with the global -f paramter.  If the primary output is transactions
+   per second, the reported inbound and outbound transfer rates will
+   be 10^6 bits per second, otherwise, they honor the setting of the
+   global -f option.
+
+   All of this is EXPERIMENTAL and subject to change without prior
+   notice in future versions of netperf.
+
+*) Replace &quot;break&quot; with &quot;break 2&quot; in acinclude.m4 for a socklen macro
+
+*) The default for the requested socket buffer size is changed from 0
+   to -1 to enable passing a value of 0 under Windows, which tells that
+   stack one wishes to enable copy-avoidance.
+
+*) Call fflush() on each interim result displayed in demo mode to make
+   things happier for folks redirecting same to a file.  From Dan
+   Yost.
+
+*) In theory each distinct netserver child will have a debug log with
+   its pid appended to the name, somewhat like what appears to happen
+   under Windows.
+
+*) A new global, command-line option to netperf and netserver has been
+   added. The -V option will cause netperf/netserver to display its
+   version and exit.
+
+*) Setting -I without setting -i will now implicitly set the iteration
+   minimum and maximums as if a -i 10,3 were set.  Also, some further
+   sanity checking on the bounds for each is made.
+
+*) Fixed a typo in the manual (found by Emir Halepovic) so the
+   description for the -s and -S options properly specifies they
+   affect the data connection.
+
+These are the Release Notes for Revision 2.4.3 of netperf:
+
+Things changed in this release:
+
+*) The UDP_STREAM test includes --enable-demo support, courtesy of
+   patches from Scott Weitzenkamp.
+
+*) The nettest_dns.* files have been removed from the release and the
+   repository.  Those wishing to perform DNS server tests should
+   migrate to netperf4 which has better support for DNS test.
+
+*) Fixes for compiling under Windows with Mingw/gcc courtesy of Gisle
+   Vanem.
+
+*) A new global option - -N - has been added. When specified, this
+   option will tell netperf to not bother to try to establish a
+   control connection with a remote netserver.  Instead, netperf will
+   only attempt to make a data connection to the remote system.  By
+   default, this will be to the &quot;discard&quot; service for a &quot;STREAM&quot; or
+   &quot;SENDFILE&quot; test, the &quot;echo&quot; service for a &quot;RR&quot; test and the
+   &quot;chargen&quot; service for a &quot;MAERTS&quot; test.  Any &quot;remote&quot; settings are
+   changed to reflect their being unused in the test, and a &quot;no
+   control&quot; tag is added to the test banner when -N is specified.
+
+   This still needs to be propagated to other test files - at least
+   for those for which it may make sense.
+
+*) The tests in nettest_bsd.c have been altered to not actually take
+   timestamps and deltas in --enable-histogram unless the verbosity
+   level has been set to actually display a histogram.  This reduces
+   the overhead measurably, even on systems with &quot;fast&quot; time calls,
+   which _may_ mean that a future release of netperf may have
+   histogram support enabled by default.
+
+   This still needs to be propagated to other test files.  Patches
+   from the community would be most welcome :)
+
+*) Eliminate a bogus fprintf from the signal catching routine which
+   was being executed when both intervals and demo mode were active at
+   the same time.
+
+*) The nettest_ipv6.* files are no longer included in the source
+   tar/zip file. IPv6 functionality has been subsumed into the
+   nettest_bsd.* files for some time now. 
+
+*) Use a higher resolution &quot;time&quot; source for HISTOGRAM support under
+   Windows, courtesy of Spencer Frink. Prior to this it had no better
+   than 10ms granularity which could lead to some rather strange
+   looking results :)
+
+*) A bug fix reporting recv_size rather than send_size in TCP_MAERTS
+   when CPU utilization was requested.
+
+*) A bug fix for buffer filling from a file to properly advance the
+   buffer pointer when the file is smaller than the send buffer.
+
+*) Enable certain UDP tests which previously used unconnected sockets 
+   to use connected sockets.  Courtesy of Shilpi Agarwal.
+
+*) The OSX CPU utilization code actually gets put into the tarball in
+   a make dist now :)
+
+*) The check to make sure that getaddrinfo returned ai_protocol and/or
+   ai_socktype's matching that which we requested is done for all socket
+   and/or protocol types and a warning is emitted if it returns any which
+   do not match.
+
+*) The linux CPU affinity code has been made capable of binding to
+   CPU's &gt;=32 on a 32-bit compilation and &gt;=64 on a 64-bit
+   compilation.
+
+*) More complete closing/redirecting of stdin/stdout/stderr/where in
+   netserver to make it easier to launch netserver at the far-end of a
+   remote shell.  Courtesy of Hans Blom.
+
+*) Sendfile changes for Solaris courtesy of Andrew Gallatin.
+
+*) &quot;spec&quot; file support to generate RPMs courtesy of Martin Brown
+
+These are the Release Notes for Revision 2.4.2 of netperf:
+
+Things changed in this release:
+
+*) Fixes for floating point format differences, courtesy of George
+   Davis.
+
+*) Additions for CPU util support on MacOS X, courtesy of Anonymous.
+
+*) Processor affinity is now supported on AIX 5.3 (perhaps earlier)
+   via the bindprocessor system call.
+
+*) Fixes for test lockups with TCP_CRR and TCP_CC under Windows
+   courtesy of Dikon Reed.
+
+*) Fixes to netcpu_looper.c to get it to actually compile :)
+
+*) Have netcpu_looper use the bind_to_specific_processor() call
+   provided by netlib since that knows about more platforms than the
+   code in netcpu_looper did. The looper CPU binding will use a
+   mapping to handle cases where the CPU id's on the system may not be
+   a contiguous space starting from zero.  At present, the code that
+   setups the mapping only knows about retrieving actual CPU ids under
+   HP-UX.
+
+*) The netcpu_sysctl method becomes calibration-free, courtesy of 
+   Andrew Gallatin
+
+These are the Release Notes for Revision 2.4.1 of netperf:
+
+Things changed in this release:
+
+*) There is now a -B global command-line argument that will append its
+   parameter as a string to the end of result lines when test banners
+   have been suppressed.  this is to make it easier to distinguish one
+   result from another when aggregate restults are being run in
+   parallel, without having to resort to having the individual results
+   shell redirected to a file. This has been done for some of the
+   tests in nettest_bsd.c, but not all of them, nor for the tests in
+   the other nettest_mumble.c files.
+
+*) There is now an --enable-spin configure option that will enable
+   intervals if not already enabled and will have the sender sit and
+   spin in a tight loop until time for the next interval rather than
+   wait for an interval timer to expire.  This means it should be
+   possible to have a much finer granularity on the interval, at the
+   expense of an EXTREME increase in CPU utilization.  (To the extent
+   I'm considering disabling measurement of local CPU utilization when
+   that mode is enabled, and bursts have been requested - your
+   feedback on that topic would be most appreciated) 
+
+   If only --enable-intervals is used with configure, the old set the
+   interval timer and wait method is still used.
+
+   If --enable-spin is configured, the test banner will include &quot;spin
+   intervals&quot; rather than the &quot;intervals&quot; from a plain
+   --enable-intervals.  The sit and spin will either use
+   gettimeofday(), or gethrtime() if gethrtime() is available.
+
+   This has been implemented in the tests of nettest_bsd.c but none of
+   the others.  Volunteers would be most welcome.  I would entertain
+   the notion of making the implementation a series of inline
+   functions in netlib. This holds true for the demo mode - why will
+   become clear when you look at nettest_bsd.c.  While things are
+   considerably cleaner than they were before, with reuse within
+   nettest_bsd.c, there is no resuse with the rest of the
+   nettest_mumble.c files.
+
+*) the -w option for the interval time now takes three optional
+   suffixes. if the suffix is 'm' (eg 10m) it will assume the user has
+   specified time in units of milliseconds.  if the suffix is 'u' it
+   will assume microseconds, and if 's' seconds. no suffix remains
+   milliseconds for backwards compatability with previous netperf
+   versions.
+
+*) It should be possible to successfully compile with
+   --enable-intervals.
+
+These are the Release Notes for Revision 2.4.1 of netperf:
+
+Things changed in this release:
+
+*) netcpu_pstatnew.c has been altered to workaround a bug in the
+   interrupt cycle accounting in HP-UX 11.23 that is not expected to
+   be resolved until a later release.  basically, some interrupt time
+   is not counted, which means the sum of idle, user, kernel and
+   interrupt is less than the cycles per second multiplied by the
+   elapsed time.  the workaround preserves the &quot;no calibration
+   required&quot; nature of the pstatnew CPU utilization mechanism.  you
+   can see more in netcpu_pstatnew.c and/or in debug output.
+
+*) in netlib.c recv_response has been renamed
+   recv_response_timed(addl_time) which is now used in
+   calibrate_remote_cpu in place of the &quot;sleep(40);recv_response()&quot;
+   sequence.  This then allows the REM_CPU test to complete in less
+   than 40 seconds when the remote's CPU utilization mechanism does
+   not require calibration.  The value of &quot;addl_time&quot; is added to the
+   tc_sec field of the select() timeout.  A &quot;new&quot; recv_response has
+   been added that simply calls recv_response_timed(0) - this is to
+   minimize the number of changes needed elsewhere in the code.
+
+*) hopefully, this release fixes problems people have been having with
+   the configure script failing when picking a type for socklen_t.
+   now, instead of generating an error, it emits a warning and simply
+   tries socklen_t
+
+*) the configure script no longer looks for the size of an in_port_t
+
+*) netlib.c now has code to perform processor binding for Tru64, but
+   the configure script may or may not detect it correctly. This means
+   that one may have to edit the config.h file by hand to get the
+   functionality.
+
+*) it is known that netperf will compile under Windows XP and 2003
+   using the DDK it is possible that netperf 2.4.1 will compile on a
+   Windows system under VC++/Visual Studio.  It might even work!-) See
+   the README.window file for additional details.
+
+Things _NOT_ changed in this release:
+
+*) The automagic determination of the number and type of parameters to
+   sched_setaffinity under Linux remains brittle at best.
+
+These are the Release Notes for Revision 2.4.0 of netperf:
+
+Things changed in this release:
+
+*) Netperf has been converted to use a configure script.  Yes boys and
+   girls, after 12 years of distributing netperf with just a makefile
+   I have finally bitten the bullet and cast my fate to autoconf,
+   automake, etc.  To get the most basic netperf built all you should
+   need to do is:
+
+   cd to the netperf directory
+   ./configure
+   make
+   and perhaps
+   make install
+
+   (Note, I've not done much with make install - I'm hemming and
+   hawing over what the default installation location should be)
+
+   Please keep in mind that this is the first time I've tried to use
+   autoconf et al. I am sure there are things that should be done
+   differently and would welcome any and all constructive criticisms.
+
+   I suspect there are several places where I've not fully
+   demonstrated being of the autoconf body - particulary as pertains
+   to include files being in &quot;#if mumble #endif&quot; blocks.  Fixes would
+   be most welcome.
+
+*) Speaking of becomming one with various GNU tools, work on a new
+   netperf manual has begun, with the source being a texinfo document
+   that is converted to &quot;all&quot; the other formats.  This resides in doc/
+   .
+
+*) The platform-specific parts of CPU utilization measurement have
+   been broken-out into separate .c files and selected at configure
+   time a la the pcap_mumble files of tcpdump.  This makes
+   src/netlib.c _much_ easier to read and the addition of new CPU
+   utilization mechanisms much easier.
+
+*) New HP-UX 11.23 and Solaris 10 CPU utilization measurement
+   mechanisms (called pstatnew and kstat10 respectively) need no
+   calibration step.  Both have variations on microstate accounting.
+   HP-UX 11.23 still identifies the method in the headers as 'P' for
+   pstat.  The kstat10 method is identified as 'M' for Microstate.
+
+   Scripts which make calibration runs with LOC_CPU and REM_CPU may
+   continue to do so, they will just run forty to eighty seconds
+   faster on platforms with the calibration-free CPU util mechanisms.
+
+*) Automatic detection of CPU utilization mechanism for HP-UX, Linux,
+   AIX, *BSD and Solaris.  If you do not like what the configure
+   script selects, you can use --enable-cpuutil=&lt;foo&gt; .
+
+*) The &quot;times&quot; (aka 'T') CPU utilization mechanism has been removed.
+   It was never very accurate at all, only showing CPU time charged to
+   the process, and with interrupts and other network processing it is
+   rarely chaged to a or the correct process.  It and other methods
+   may remain in the format_cpu_method() routine of src/netlib.c for
+   historical purposes only.
+
+*) CAVEAT - the &quot;kstat&quot; mechanism is KNOWN TO BE BOGUS for Solaris.
+   It does not include time spent processing interrupts, and
+   networking benchmarks will generate at least a few of those...
+   This affects _ALL_ versions of Solaris with kstat.
+
+   So, do NOT trust any CPU util figures where netperf says the method
+   was 'K' for kstat - unless perhaps it reports 100% CPU util.
+
+   Solaris 10 takes a step in the right direction adding microstate
+   accounting similar to what netperf uses on HP-UX 11.23.  HOWEVER,
+   Solaris 10's accounting for user/kernel/idle is done in _parallel_
+   with interrupt, which means they overlap. Doubleplusungood. Netperf
+   attempts to compensate for that with some handwaving
+   (src/netcpu_kstat10.c)
+
+*) Initial support for SCTP has been added with the SCTP_STREAM and
+   SCTP_RR tests.  These tests use the libsctp mechanisms for
+   increased portability.  It has been explained that libsctp should
+   not impart all that much overhead and it does make things rather
+   simpler.
+
+*) Netperf now uses getaddrinfo() to resolve hostnames and IP
+   addresses. A replacement getaddrinfo() is provided for those
+   platforms where the configure script cannot tell that getaddrinfo
+   is present.   
+
+   There are cases where a host's getaddrinfo call may return results
+   that ignore the hints for protocol.  Netperf catches these and
+   reports a warning so you can pester your OS source for fixes.
+
+   Solaris getaddrinfo() seems to return results with SCTP procotol
+   cleared.
+
+   Mac OS X getaddrinfo botches when the service/port is specified as
+   &quot;0&quot; so one must specify a port number on the netperf command line.
+
+   AIX 5.something getaddrinfo has a different but similar problem
+   with &quot;0&quot; as a port/service name as well.
+
+   Linux 2.6 and HP-UX 11i getaddrinfo seem to be fine - at least as
+   far as netperf goes :)
+
+*) A &quot;Demo Mode&quot; has been added to the main BSD Sockets/TCP/UDP tests:
+   TCP_STREAM, TCP_MAERTS, TCP_SENDFILE, TCP_RR, TCP_CC, TCP_CRR and
+   UDP_RR. It has not been added to UDP_STREAM.  This mode is enabled
+   with --enable-demo when configuring netperf, which activates a
+   global &quot;-D&quot; option.  By default, -D will cause interim results
+   (throughput or transactions/s only, not CPU util) from the
+   netperf's perspective to be emitted no sooner than once per second.
+   An optional parameter can specify another interval in units
+   (floating point) of seconds:
+
+      -D 1.5
+
+   will make the reporting interval at least 1.5 seconds.
+
+   This mode makes no use of explicit interval timers since that can
+   be so, well fun on different platforms.  Instead, an initial guess
+   of how many units of work must be done to consume the desired
+   reporting interval is made, and that guess is refined throughout
+   the entire test.  If something happens to dramatically slow-down
+   the test, the reproting interval may become must larger for a few
+   intervals.  When things speed-up it is detected very quickly.  As
+   with the --enable-historgram support, if gethrtime() is available
+   on the platform, it will be used in lieu of gettimeofday().  In any
+   case, the number of calls to gettimeofday()/gethrtime() is much,
+   Much, MUCH smaller than for --enable-histogram so while there may
+   be a measurable effect on the results, it should be rather small.
+
+*) The global -H option has been enhanced to take an optional address
+   family specification for the control connection:
+
+   -H &lt;remote&gt;,&lt;family&gt;
+
+   Unlike other comma-separated options, where specifying only one
+   thing will set both, here specifying only one thing will be
+   ass-u-me-d to be the &lt;remote&gt; and will leave &lt;family&gt; defaulted
+   (AF_UNSPEC).   Family can be specified as &quot;4&quot; or &quot;inet&quot; for
+   AF_INET, &quot;6&quot; or &quot;inet6&quot; for AF_INET6.
+
+*) A new global -L option has been added to specify the local name/IP
+   and/or address family for the control connection:
+
+   -L &lt;local&gt;,&lt;family&gt;
+
+   Unlike other comma-separated options, where specifying only one
+   thing will set both, here specifying only one thing will be
+   ass-u-me-d to be the &lt;local&gt; and will leave &lt;family&gt; defaulted
+   (AF_UNSPEC).  Family can be specified as &quot;4&quot; or &quot;inet&quot; for
+   AF_INET, &quot;6&quot; or &quot;inet6&quot; for AF_INET6.
+
+*) Test-specific -H and -L options are present for the TCP, UDP and
+   SCTP tests, which are now (intended to be) IP protocol version
+   agnostic.
+
+*) Global -4 and -6 options will set the both the local and remote
+   address family to either AF_INET or AF_INET6 respectively.
+
+*) Test-specific -4 and -6 options have been added for TCP, UDP and
+   SCTP tests.
+
+*) Since the basic TCP UDP and SCTP tests are no longer IPv4-only, the
+   nettest_ipv6.[ch] files are only included in the source
+   distribution for historical interest.
+
+*) The main test banners for the TCP, UDP and SCTP tests have been
+   enhanced to give both local and remote addressing information for
+   the data connection.
+
+*) Compilation under Windows is likely FUBAR at this point.  I _hope_
+   to start trying to do builds under the DDK soon, but am not sure
+   when I'll be able to start.  Any and all assistance you can give
+   there would be most welcome.
+
+*) Various and sundry fixes.  TCP_RR should no longer go into an
+   infinite loop when you abort netperf.  I'm sure there are others.
+
+*) Unix domain socket tests are compiled-in with --enable-unix=yes at
+   configure time.
+
+*) DLPI tests are compiled-in with --enable-dlpi=yes at configure
+   time.
+
+*) XTI tests are compiled-in with --enable-xti=yes at configure time. 
+
+Things not changed in this release:
+
+*) Seems like everything has changed :)
+
+These are the Release Notes for Revision 2.3pl2 of netperf:
+
+Things changed in this release
+
+*) One can bind netperf or netserver to specific CPUs with the -T
+   option. This is a generalization of some HP-UX and netserver specific
+   work from 2.3pl1.
+
+*) Extend the kludge to workaround the Linux setsockopt/getsockopt
+   bizzarreness to the socket buffer sizes for the remote side in
+   addition to the local side.
+
+*) Fix the lack of initialization of times_up in recv_tcp_maerts()
+   that caused confidence intervals to fail miserably.
+
+*) Other misc fixes - than you to all of you who sent them.
+
+These are the Release Notes for revision 2.3pl1 of netperf:
+
+Things changed in this release
+
+*) The bind() call in create_data_socket() in the file nettest_bsd.c
+   is no longer conditional on the user's specifying an IP address or
+   port number to which the data socket should be bound.  This fixes
+   the &quot;connection refused&quot; errors in the UDP tests.
+
+*) Some experimental code to allow one to specify a CPU to which the
+   remote netserver should be bound.  This is intended to allow one to
+   get greater certainty (as in confidence intervals) on SMP
+   systems. At present the functionality is HP-UX specific.
+   Submittals of changes for a more general approach are welcomed.
+
+These are the Release Notes for revision 2.3 of netperf:
+
+Things changed in this release
+
+*) The user can now specify local and/or remote port numbers for the
+   data connection using the -P test-specific option.  This is to
+   support those folks who want to run netperf through those evil,
+   end-to-end-breaking things known as firewalls... :)  This changes
+   the format of some of the control messages, hence the bump in the
+   update number in the VUF. While it may be possible to mix 2.3 and
+   pre-2.3 netperf and netserver, it is not supported.
+
+*) The user can now specify local and/or remote IP addresses for the
+   data connection using the -I test-specific option.  This is to
+   support those folks who want to run netperf through those evil,
+   end-to-end-breaking things known as firewalls... :) This changes
+   the format of some of the control messages, hence the bump in the
+   update number in the VUF. While it may be possible to mix 2.3 and
+   pre-2.3 netperf and netserver, it is not supported.
+
+*) Set DL_mumble  message priorities in the DLPI tests
+
+*) Fix error return check for getaddrinfo()
+
+*) Those systems with gethrtime() can define -DHAVE_GETHRTIME to use
+   gethrtime() instead of gettimeofday() and reduce the measurement
+   overhead when enabling the -DHISTOGRAM functionality.
+
+*) The default for -DHISTOGRAM compilation now adds a UNIT_USEC and
+   TEN_USEC row and renames TENTH_MSEC to HUNDRED_USEC.  If you want
+   the old behaviour add -DOLD_HISTOGRAM to CFLAGS.
+
+*) Add missing '!' in the recv_udp*_stream so we recognize the end of 
+   a timed test correctly.
+
+*) Replace &quot;||&quot; with &quot;&amp;&amp;&quot; to fix an infinite loop in
+   recv_tcp_conn_rr() most likely introduced in 2.2pl5. 
+
+*) Code has been added to kludge around the bug in Linux getsockopt()
+   where it almost always returns twice the value for which one
+   asks unlike virtually every other stack on the face of the
+   planet. This was doing some unpleasant things to tests in which
+   confidence intervals were requested. 
+
+Things not changed in this release
+
+*) Lots :)
+
+These are the Release Notes for revision 2.2pl5 of netperf:
+
+Things changed in this release
+
+*) Improved (perhaps even usable :) support for Windows, including
+compilation and run on Win64.
+
+*) Fixes for MacOS X and FreeBSD
+
+Things not changed in this release
+
+*) Specifying the port number(s) for the data connection
