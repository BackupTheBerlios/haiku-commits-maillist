&gt;<i> &gt;c) GetMouse() and DispatchMessage() would not need any extra code
</I>&gt;<i> I am not sure about that, since Ingo's solution works at the BWindow

</I>&gt;<i> (global), while the no-history-flag works at the view level. So I 
</I>&gt;<i> guess the 
</I>&gt;<i> BWindow level code would always have to provide the history and there

</I>&gt;<i> have to at least be some extra code in GetMouse().
</I>
With no history, the code could always choose the latest message in the 
queue, though, so at least the app_server wouldn't need to send all 
mouse messages separately this way (it would only do that if one view 
had the all-pointer-history flag set).

&gt;<i> &gt; d) it doesn't matter how slow the system is, it would always work
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reliable.
</I>&gt;<i> The current method does work reliable. It may do too much on a slow 
</I>&gt;<i> system 
</I>&gt;<i> as per my TODO comment, which is obviously undesired. But reliable it 
</I>&gt;<i> is.
</I>
Reliability was the wrong term without a context - I meant a reliably 
working pointer history :-)

&gt;<i> &gt; Ingo's suggestion has the added advantage that no actual messages 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; are 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sent for each mouse button when it's not needed, so that save some 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; cycles.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But that can be done at later point, too.
</I>&gt;<i> To me it looks, like the proposed method would have some benefits, 
</I>&gt;<i> but not 
</I>&gt;<i> all the ones you outlined (reduced complexity and added reliability). 
</I>&gt;<i> Since 
</I>&gt;<i> the current solution works, I am inclined to be lazy, especially 
</I>&gt;<i> since I 
</I>&gt;<i> have some other stuff that interests me currently. Like experimenting 
</I>&gt;<i> with 
</I>&gt;<i> subpixel rendering methods or implementing playlist loading/saving in 
</I>&gt;<i> MediaPlayer or looping and repeat modes... :-) But someone else, 
</I>&gt;<i> please 
</I>&gt;<i> feel free to implement it! :-P
</I>
As long as it's still acceptable on slow systems (which I guess it is), 
the suggested changes would definitely fall under the category of 
optimizations, now. At least I don't plan to look into that before R1/
alpha, and maybe I've forgotten about it when we're there ;-)

Bye,
   Axel.
