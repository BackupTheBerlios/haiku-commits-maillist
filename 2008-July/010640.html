<PRE>Hi,

Ok, I was able to test this now on real hardware and here are some very 
limited but encouraging results:

ZETA: (1.83 GHz Core 2 Duo, 1 GB RAM, PCIe X300 Radeon with Haiku driver)

Glyphs per DrawString() call: 60
Glyphs per second: 74735.807
Average time between iterations: 0.0103 seconds.
Time to run the test:
real    0m50.111s
user    0m0.285s
sys     0m0.098s


Haiku (2.00 GHz Core 2 Duo, 2 GB RAM, PCIe X1400 Radeon in VESA mode)

Glyphs per DrawString() call: 60
Glyphs per second: 388639.420
Average time between iterations: 0.0011 seconds.
Time to run the test:
real 0m9.315s
user 0m0.161s
sys  0m0.127s


No, I did not mistype those results... :-) This is how this particular test 
is performed: A BView runs a DrawString test which draws as much lines of 
text as fit into the window (500x500 pixels). As long as another iteration 
is to be performed, the view invalidates itself right in the Draw() 
routine. The DrawString test measures the time between the start of one 
iteration until after calling BView::Sync() returns. When Sync() returns, 
the app_server will have actually drawn everything to screen on ZETA, while 
in Haiku it will have only finished rendering to the main memory drawing 
buffer  which is flushed to the screen to elliminate flickering (VESA mode 
only) after the window completely finished redrawing. The drawing mode used 
for the test was B_OP_OVER. On ZETA this means the app_server reads the 
frame buffer contents and alpha blends the font glyphs. This is a hit for 
performance. On Haiku, it does the same, but reads the frame buffer from 
main memory. However, ZETA is able to use acceleration for clearing the 
view background at each iteration of the test, while Haiku has to use the 
CPU for that and needs one more copy operation into the frame buffer. On 
ZETA, both CPUs are at about 50% to 60% usage during the test, while on 
Haiku, one CPU is peaked (the app_server thread which does the rendering).

Summary: In this particular test, Haiku beats ZETA by an overall factor of 
5.4 even though it runs in VESA mode. Very interesting is also the &quot;round 
trip time&quot; where Haiku blows ZETA away by a factor of 9.36. This is the 
time that is &quot;leaked&quot; between the test runs, ie the time it takes from 
invoking BView::Invalidate() until the BView::Draw() hook is called the 
next time. Another promising number is the user time to run the test, where 
Haiku performs 1.77 times faster (the processor is 1.11 times faster). The 
time spent inside the kernel though is longer on Haiku, by a factor of 1.3.

To top this all off, Haiku had subpixel anti-aliasing turned on. I tried 
with it turned off, but there is no difference in the timings, which is 
pretty neat in itself. :-)

I will post results for B_OP_COPY as well, here ZETA should perform much 
faster since it does not need to read the frame buffer.

Best regards,
-Stephan
