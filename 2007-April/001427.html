+\fn status_t (*file_system_module_info::mount)(mount_id id, const char *device,
+	uint32 flags, const char *args, fs_volume *_fs, vnode_id *_rootVnodeID)
+\brief Mount a volume according to the specified parameters.
+
+Invoked by the VFS when it has been requested to mount the volume. The FS is
+supposed to perform whatever one-time initialization is necessary for the
+volume. It is required to create a volume handle for the volume and pass it
+back in \a _fs. Moreover it must invoke publish_vnode() for the root node
+of the volume and pass the ID of the volume back in \a _rootVnodeID.
+
+A disk-based FS will need to check whether \a device is not \c NULL, open
+it, and analyze whether the device or image file actually represents a volume
+of that FS type.
+
+If mounting the volume fails for whatever reason, the hook must return an
+error code other than \c B_OK. In this case all resources allocated by the
+hook must be freed before returning. If and only if \c B_OK is returned, the
+unmount() hook will be invoked at a later point when unmounting the volume.
+
+\param id The ID of the volume to be mounted. It should be saved in the FS's
+	volume private data (volume handle).
+\param device The path to the device (or image file) representing the volume
+	to be mounted. Can be \c NULL.
+\param flags Flags:
+	- \c B_MOUNT_READ_ONLY: Mount the volume read-only.
+\param args Null-terminated string in driver settings format, containing FS
+	specific parameters.
+\param _fs Pointer to a pre-allocated variable the volume handle shall be

+- \c io_size: Preferred size of the buffers passed to read() and write().
+- \c total_blocks: Total number of blocks the volume contains.
+- \c free_blocks: Number of free blocks on the volume.
+- \c total_nodes: Maximal number of nodes the volume can contain. If there is
+	no such limitation use \c LONGLONG_MAX.
+- \c free_nodes: Number of additional nodes the volume could contain. If there
+	is no such limitation use \c LONGLONG_MAX.
+- \c device_name: The name of the device or image file containing the volume.
+	Non-disk-based FSs shall fill in an empty string.
+- \c volume_name: The name of the volume.

+
+Note that a directory must contain the special entries \c &quot;.&quot; and \c &quot;..&quot;,
+referring to the same directory and the parent directory respectively.

+Which hooks a FS module should provide mainly depends on what functionality
+it features. E.g. a FS without support for attribute, indices, and/or queries
+can omit the respective hooks (i.e. set them to \c NULL in the module
+structure). Some hooks are mandatory, though. A minimal read-only FS module
+must implement:

+  Mounting and unmounting a volume is required for pretty obvious reasons.

+- \link file_system_module_info::lookup lookup() \endlink:
+  The VFS uses this hook to resolve path names. It is probably one of the
+  most frequently invoked hooks.

+  \link file_system_module_info::put_vnode put_vnode() \endlink:
+  Create respectively destroy the FS's private node handle when
+  the VFS creates/deletes the vnode for a particular node.

+- \link file_system_module_info::read_stat read_stat() \endlink:
+  Return a &lt;tt&gt;struct stat&lt;/tt&gt; info for the given node, consisting of the

+
+- \link file_system_module_info::read read() \endlink:
+  Read data from an opened node (file). Even if the FS does not feature files,
+  the hook has to be present anyway; it should return an error in this case.

+  Open and close a directory for entry iteration as explained in \ref concepts.
+
+- \link file_system_module_info::read_dir read_dir() \endlink and
+  \link file_system_module_info::rewind_dir rewind_dir() \endlink:
+  Read the next entry/entries from a directory, respectively reset the iterator
+  to the first entry, as explained in \ref concepts.
+
+Although not strictly mandatory, a FS should additionally implement the
+following hooks:
+
+- \link file_system_module_info::read_fs_info read_fs_info() \endlink:
+  Return general information about the volume, e.g. total and free size, and
+  what special features (attributes, MIME types, queries) the volume/FS
+  supports.
+
+- \link file_system_module_info::read_symlink read_symlink() \endlink:
+  Read the value of a symbolic link. Needed only, if the FS and volume support
+  symbolic links at all. If absent symbolic links stored on the volume won't
+  be interpreted.
+
+- \link file_system_module_info::access access() \endlink:
+  Return whether the current user has the given access permissions for a node.
+  If the hook is absent the user is considerd to have all permissions.
