</I>&gt;<i> Well, you're cheating -- you wrote the function in the first place. :

</I>
I know, but that was a few years ago - it's not that I like what I did, 
I'm just not sure you really improved it :-))

&gt;<i> BTW, although l33t, I don't really think a &quot;... += ... = ... = ...&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> construct is really good to read, especially, if it extends a single 
</I>&gt;<i> line.
</I>
You're definitely right :-)

&gt;<i> &gt; After all, the vecOffset is a special case that only affects the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; first
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; iovec;
</I>&gt;<i> True enough, but since it's cheap enough to do it in general, I don't 
</I>&gt;<i> see 
</I>&gt;<i> the need for special casing it, particularly since that special case 
</I>&gt;<i> look 
</I>&gt;<i> completely different than the handling in the loop (code readability-
</I>&gt;<i> - ;-).
</I>
Hehe :-)

&gt;<i> &gt; now, you have doubled the number of loops without good reason.
</I>&gt;<i> Not completely without good reason. The up-front &quot;vecLeft == 0&quot; check 
</I>&gt;<i> is 
</I>&gt;<i> needed to prevent zero-length tempVecs (which aren't fatal, but not 
</I>&gt;<i> nice 
</I>&gt;<i> anyway) and increasing i requires a check against count with a 
</I>&gt;<i> possible 
</I>&gt;<i> termination of the loop (which the loop head delivers). So the only 
</I>&gt;<i> thing 
</I>&gt;<i> really doubled are the two other checks in the loop condition.
</I>
True enough, but the &quot;vecLeft == 0&quot; check could be completely outside 
the loop, it doesn't give you any bonus.
But anyway - the problem is ugly in itself, there probably isn't the 
perfect and immediately appealing solution (to both of us) - and since 
it works as is, I wouldn't mind keeping it that way :-)

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; * Also set *_numBytes in case all fileVecs have been processed. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Only
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;   relevant in case the request extends beyond the end of file.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In that case, it would already have dropped out earlier in the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; loop, so
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don't think this is necessary.
</I>&gt;<i> I don't see where. If 200 KB shall be read, but the fileVecs provide 
</I>&gt;<i> only 
</I>&gt;<i> 100 KB (ATM that can happen e.g. when the file is heavily fragmented 
</I>&gt;<i> and 
</I>&gt;<i> MAX_FILE_IO_VECS fileVecs don't suffice), all fileVecs will be 
</I>&gt;<i> processed 
</I>&gt;<i> and the outer loop simply terminates. None of the error conditions in 
</I>&gt;<i> the 
</I>&gt;<i> inner loops will have been met.
</I>
How dare you to solve eventual problems that the calling code doesn't 
care about? :-))
I only considered the &quot;end-of-file&quot; case, not the &quot;heavily-fragmented-
file&quot; case - in fact the code completely neglects it as well; maybe 
read_chunk_into_cache() and write_chunk_to_cache() should take that 
into account?
When I look at that code with that error condition in mind, I see at 
least two bugs in each of them...
I'll look into that tomorrow, thanks for the hint :-)

Bye,
   Axel.
