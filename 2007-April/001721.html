BeOS style semaphores have always been problematic in this regard.  
Since there is no concept of ownership (any thread can release any  
sem), boosting the 'owner'  doesn't necessarily help, because the  
last acquirer isn't necessarily the one that is going to release it.  
It seems most other systems have a few different locking primitive  
types (mutexes, reader/writer, single count sems, events, condition  
vars) each for a specific purpose, which gives the kernel some better  
hints as to what the locking is for.

It's probably one of the reasons BeOS never had any real priority  
boosting when acquiring sems, because at that level deep in the  
kernel it's really unclear what the purpose of the sem acquire/ 
release is for.

I was thinking it might be useful to pass some hints to  
acquire_sem_etc and maybe release_sem_etc that says what it's for,  
such as 'this is for waiting on IO' or 'this is an event blocker' or  
'this is just a plain old mutex' so it could decide to boost after IO  
more heavily than just a regular old mutex. For at least the sems  
deep in the kernel that are wrapping around a disk queue or so they  
could easily use it.

Another strategy I've thought about is simply moving away from  
semaphores as the One True Lock, but we'd have to consider how that'  
effect compatibility and debugging. I suppose if we just expanded the  
semaphore id namespace to really include all locking primitives then  
the idea that a thread is blocked on a 'lock' is still pretty much  
the same as before. Just a thought.
