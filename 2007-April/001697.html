As I wrote, I'm not opposed to put tests into the image in general. If 
networking is a hot spot ATM and feedback from testers, particularly output 
from certain test programs, is desired, then I'm perfectly fine with 
including them. But if every developer includes all his tests, then we'll end 
up with an image twice as big, including a lot of obsolete tests. E.g. I know 
how my UserBuildConfig looks like and I know that most of the stuff I put on 
my image is of little interest to others.

&gt;<i> Distributing the raw development image is violating a lot of licenses,
</I>&gt;<i> those people building and *distributing* their images are in a legal
</I>&gt;<i> jeopardy.
</I>
That's right. You mentioned it before and I replied in pretty much the same 
we I'm replying now: We *do* already distribute the image 
(<A HREF="http://factory.haiku-os.org/">http://factory.haiku-os.org/</A>); either we stop doing this or fix the 
licensing problems. It's just that obviously noone cares enough.

&gt;<i> I think we should not try to transform the development image into
</I>&gt;<i> any kind of distribution. Including as much as useful for development
</I>&gt;<i> should be the way to go.
</I>
I fully agree, that we should favor development use. Which is exactly why I 
don't want to have every imaginable test on it, since that adds to everyone's 
turn-around times.

CU, Ingo
