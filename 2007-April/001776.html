  With my current approach, the hash call is resolved statically (what
i call a direct call). It will result in a static jmp/call and
possibly in inlining the hash as the template provides for the static
instantiation of the call path. The khash approach (or one that uses
wrappers/virtual calls) uses indirect calls, branches which depend on
state (function pointer), i.e. call *%register, which may be quite
negative for some branch predictors.

</I>
  I'm not using them either, but it's my responsability. If i want to
debug a trickier case, i should disable inlining. It will always be
used elsewhere anyway.

&gt;<i> That's not really true: an open addressing hash table wastes more

</I>
  There is in fact an explicit amount of waste with open addressing as
we don't want the load factor to go over a certain threshold due to
the impact it would have in the collision domain. However, this may
not be considered independently, it is not as if with chaining you'll
be using all of the buckets everytime (the joys of perfect hashing).
Open addressing does put an higher requirement on a better hash while
Chaining appears to be &quot;safer&quot;, in the sense that a collision affect
only a single bucket, but both degenerate with bad hashes.

  If we consider expanding the hash table when the load factor is at
80%, we have a constant maximum waste of 20%. This overhead would only
be larger than with chaining if an equivalent chained hash table load
was always kept below 20% (which is in fact also the factor i'm using
to reduce the table size). I would argue that open addressing provides
for less memory overhead in average for common usages, not more.

  Although not as significant for cache locality as including the
whole items in the table as you mentioned, open addressing is still
better for cache locality on collisions, as the &quot;next&quot; pointers are
potentially already in cache (loaded in the previous cache line) while
with chaining there is no cache locality whatsoever -- you always need
load a distant next to get the next item.

&gt;<i> BTW I learned that as open hash (chaining) and closed hash (open
</I>&gt;<i> address) - quite confusing :-)
</I>
  Oh. :-) I've used both terms, but tend to prefer chaining/open
addressing as i feel they better express the underlying algorithms.
