</I>
Can't follow you here. There is nothing wrong with a templated wrapper, 
but I can't see the requirement you mention.

&gt;<i> And regarding inline not helping with
</I>&gt;<i> debugging, gcc has -fno-inline exactly for that, to turn off inlining
</I>&gt;<i> when it is not desired.
</I>
Which only covers debugging builds which is not what 100% of the people 
outside will use (or even I :-)).

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I would also like to point out that this OpenHashTable
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; is not the same as kash (open addressing vs. chaining).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Which only gives you the benefit of not clobbering your objects - 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; at
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the cost of either more memory consumption or more allocations/
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; copies
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (which isn't really acceptable for most kernel services).
</I>&gt;<i>   I don't want to enter in a discussion of whether chaining is better
</I>&gt;<i> than open addressing. I feel that people usually use chaining because
</I>&gt;<i> that's what they are most familiar with. However open addressing has
</I>&gt;<i> very nice features, including cache locality and of course the fact
</I>&gt;<i> that it doesn't require extra storage besides the table itself.
</I>
Which our hash table doesn't either as it puts the extra requiements 
into the objects that are part of the table.
The *only* advantage of open addressing would be a higher cache 
locality, but that is not true when comparing the two versions in our 
repository - because of the somewhat ugly &quot;next&quot; pointer as part of the 
object. This completely nullifies that advantage - it would only still 
be true if whole objects are stored in the table instead of pointers to 
them (ie. pointerless).

[...]
&gt;<i>   Just a comment on your comment. :-) I'm not sure i agree with your
</I>&gt;<i> point regarding memory usage. In terms of chaining, getting multiple
</I>&gt;<i> items in a single bucket is not good for performance, and if your 
</I>&gt;<i> hash
</I>&gt;<i> has bad pathological cases it can really degenerate. Anyway,
</I>&gt;<i> collisions are a property of the hash function, so they affect both
</I>&gt;<i> implementations.
</I>
Well, as you correctly point out, that's the case with both 
implementations, there is no advantage on either side here.

&gt;<i> There is no memory waste in open addressing, we
</I>&gt;<i> expand the table to open the hash domain and minimize collisions,
</I>&gt;<i> which just like with chaining have an impact on performance.
</I>
That's not really true: an open addressing hash table wastes more 
memory because it has higher requirements on the load factor; it's 
performance gets substantially worse with high load. And that also 
impacts all hash operations, while with the chaining solution, table 
insertions are always fast, no matter how many collisions there are. 
And finally, open addressing degenerates for many items in case there 
is one slot with a high number of collisions.

BTW I learned that as open hash (chaining) and closed hash (open 
address) - quite confusing :-)

Bye,
   Axel.
