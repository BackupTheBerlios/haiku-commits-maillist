<PRE>Hi Axel,

  Each cache maintains storage for a single type, or size. Having
malloc() using a slab allocator would involve having several caches
for several different sizes and translate the requested size into one
of the caches. By grouping common allocations we reduce the internal
fragmentation by a large factor. Larger sizes would drain pages
directly.

  Concerning the implementation, typically in literature we have
either small or large slabs, where the first have the bufctls merged
with the buffers and the second uses external storage and potentially
an hash table to index the buffers (which Bonwick even refers to). I
have thus far implemented three strategies. Note that in the current
implementation I have thus far kept the Link separate from the buffer
data to facilitate debugging. Now that it is working, and i've done
some additional tests, i'll change both MergedLinks to merge the link
with the buffer data, as it is only required when the buffer is
sitting in the slab. This means the MergedLink will have zero overhead
per buffer. I might possibly remove the second MergedLink as well if
it proves unnecessary, it was only a test anyway. The strategies are:

  - the MergedLink approach which keeps the link at the end of the
buffer itself. This strategy requires that the pages that were
allocated be in the total byte boundary as pointer math is used to
deduce the slab location from the object pointer, so usually only a
single page is used. This is optimized for very small objects.

  - the MergedLinkAndSlab is similiar to the previous one but removes
the requirement of the pages needing to be aligned to the total size
by keeping a pointer to the corresponding slab per buffer (one word
overhead total, per buffer).

  - finally the Hash strategy which packs objects tightly in a slab
and uses external storage and a hash table to index them. This is one
is useful to pack objects nicely in multiple pages so its better for
larger objects.

  What the public slab API is doing is picking a potentially
appropriate strategy for the requested object size.

  Lastly, still concerning malloc, we can have several sizes other
than power of 2, but not different sizes in the same cache. So the
slab allocator in all is a collection of caches, which considering
that they can be locked individually provide for decent scalability
(which the depot/magazines surpass anyway). Just a bit more of info,
the original Solaris slab allocator kept around ~30 caches from 8 to
~9k bytes with around 10-20% increments between them.
