  I think this could be done iteratively. Note that i don't like
having more than one interface to accomplish the same goal as well,
but i prefer to introduce a new one if i see it as a better approach
than to use a limited one. Obviously people may not agree with it
being better.

</I>
  I don't like the duality either, i would prefer C++ only
strongly-typed versions. :-)

&gt;<i> I would also move internal hash stuff into a type free non-template

</I>&gt;<i> implementation (like the lookup) could easily be made inlined as well -

</I>
  Although OpenHashTable could be very well converted to use void * as
Value Type, the template is absolutely a requirement to generate
direct calls instead of indirect ones. This is particularly important
in order to have very tight Lookups() when hashing is very simple
(which is usually the case). And regarding inline not helping with
debugging, gcc has -fno-inline exactly for that, to turn off inlining
when it is not desired.

&gt;<i> &gt; I would also like to point out that this OpenHashTable
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is not the same as kash (open addressing vs. chaining).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Which only gives you the benefit of not clobbering your objects - at
</I>&gt;<i> the cost of either more memory consumption or more allocations/copies
</I>&gt;<i> (which isn't really acceptable for most kernel services).
</I>
  I don't want to enter in a discussion of whether chaining is better
than open addressing. I feel that people usually use chaining because
that's what they are most familiar with. However open addressing has
very nice features, including cache locality and of course the fact
that it doesn't require extra storage besides the table itself.

  I went with open addressing to implement the hash table slab
strategy, where buffer links are kept externally (used for large
buffers). In this particular case i get zero collisions by using the
relevant address bits as hash and thus don't need to keep any extra
unused space.

  Just a comment on your comment. :-) I'm not sure i agree with your
point regarding memory usage. In terms of chaining, getting multiple
items in a single bucket is not good for performance, and if your hash
has bad pathological cases it can really degenerate. Anyway,
collisions are a property of the hash function, so they affect both
implementations. There is no memory waste in open addressing, we
expand the table to open the hash domain and minimize collisions,
which just like with chaining have an impact on performance.

  Of course open addressing isn't a perfect algorithm either: 1.
collisions bring side effects where they _might_ affect other hash
buckets and 2. to keep Remove() O(1) we have to mark the deleted
slots.
