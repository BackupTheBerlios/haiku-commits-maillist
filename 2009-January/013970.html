I found that a bit odd at first too. But then I quickly got used to it and decided it looked slick. It's a quick change, though, if need be.

&gt;<i> The second gripe would be that the window border looks much too 
</I>&gt;<i> present; due to its flatter appearance, it looks actually larger than 
</I>&gt;<i> usually, and I can't say I like that either.
</I>
Well... and I don't like the much too rounded appearance of the previous border. And shrinking the border by one pixel is not really a good option, because we have a lot of places with hard coded window border width, no?

&gt;<i> The final one would be that the rest of the GUI doesn't fit it as well, 
</I>&gt;<i> but I guess that's just a temporary thing :-)
</I>
Yeah, I would hope so. Don't really want to commit everything at once, because there are too many issues with the patch (where it breaks some existing app, or does not work correctly in itself). I would rather like to look at each problem in turn. And I figured, the new decorator look would not intrude too much on the existing GUI.

Anyways. Just as you can name three things you don't like about the new look, I can certainly name you three things I don't like about the old look, and I could probably name you three different things from your list, which I think could still be improved, like the decorator button symbols. If you ask another person, maybe we end up with nine items in the list... I don't know what to do about this. Either I go ahead and do some changes on the look now, which seems to be sore spot with many users checking out Haiku, or we render ourselves immovable, because we cannot agree on the perfect new look. :-\

Best regards,
-Stephan
