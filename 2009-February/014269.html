I just deleted everything in the generated folder aside from downloads and re-configured.

</I>
The chmods are in the guide. Now, I did just the above and you're totally right!
Obviously, I have messed up some permissions in the generated folder.
I'll change instructions accordingly.

&gt;<i> On another slightly related note, I'm a bit surprised to see that we

</I>
That was my thought in the beginning also. OTOH since the need for compiling/installing 
from source will probably remain until R1 or at least a beta, and that may be many months 
off, I was convinced that it makes sense to include instructions for the early adopting, 
beleadingedge users out there.
Once R1 (or some advanced beta) is out with the final installation method working (mayhaps 
an iso), these instruction will be replaced with the Haiku Approved Method(tm) or at least 
relegated to an advanced section.

I followed these instructions, which were garnered from various forum posts, and didn't 
have any problems. That, being a relative Linux newbie and almost never having to build 
stuff myself. OK, that sudo business wasn't quite right, but with your help we're getting 
there. :)

Humdinger
