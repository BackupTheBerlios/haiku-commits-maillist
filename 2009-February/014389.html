<PRE>Hi Karsten,

I saw that and it was on my mental TODO list. :-)

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 5) BMenuField looks too much like a BButton, which can be confusing. But everybody told you so already ;-)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I would like to keep it this way, but I was thinking to reduce the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> contrast of the outermost edged-in frame. To me, the re-use of certain 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> surface looks, like buttons, scrollbars and menufields, help make a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> consistent look.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I like the new look very much! But please don't forget about the fact 
</I>&gt;<i> that a BMenuField can have the fixed length. As you can see in the Mouse 
</I>&gt;<i> prefs focus follows mouse thing, long text will draw over the menu field 
</I>&gt;<i> arrow area. Also the menu field in Diskprobe is cut off on the right.
</I>
Yes, thanks for noticing.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 7) BSlider bars and active BTab are rounded, when everything else moved from the R5 more rounded look to Haiku's sharper one. This seems inconsistent, and rounding looks dated these days.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> While I was designing, I continually got the feedback that things were 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not round enough. I had hoped to integrate some roundness with this, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> while not making things too inconsistent. I was thinking to also give 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the progress bar round corners like the slider bar to get more consistency.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I would also vote for less rounded corners, maybe going with 2x2 px edges.
</I>
The BTabView should be the only control with actual round *corners*, 
while the sliders use a half circle. I like that very much for it's 
simplicity. Actual round corners are a visually more complicated shape, 
and therefore I would like to keep the slider look. I particularly like 
the slider bar look. Only the triangle thumb is giving me trouble.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 8) BProgressBar, BGroupBox and BMenuBar are splendids!
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I also noticed that some gradients are in fact only composed of two colors. It's very visible on scrollbars, and I'm not sure it's expected.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> No, that is a gloss effect. These gradients are actually composed of 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> four colors, but I may have used too little contrast. I have noticed 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that the effect is more visible on my very good monitor, and less 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> visible on my laptop. So I may have to tweak the contrast a bit, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> however, I don't like strong glossy effects too much.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you change the e.g, B_PANEL_BACKGROUND_COLOR in appearance pref to
</I>&gt;<i> something like yellow, the BTabView looks totally broken.
</I>
I have tested a bit with changing the main panel bg color, but that was 
before I got around to the BTabView... :-)

Anyways, I am not happy with how that works yet. The current 
implementation uses a lot of tint_color() around a &quot;base&quot; color. But 
that is flawed, since the current tints are optimized for the 216 gray. 
What would work better is to determine the maximum shine and shadow 
color based on the current bg color and then place all other tints 
between those. I believe that would give better results to make the 
maximum shine/shadow colors a fixed (scaled) brightness away from the 
base color, instead of always tinting between black and white extremes. 
That will involve some refactoring in BControlLook, but it's something I 
wanted to do yet.

Best regards,
-Stephan
