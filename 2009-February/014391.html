<PRE>Hi Stephan,


&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;&gt;<i> I would also vote for less rounded corners, maybe going with 2x2 px edges.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The BTabView should be the only control with actual round *corners*, 
</I>&gt;<i> while the sliders use a half circle. I like that very much for it's 
</I>&gt;<i> simplicity. Actual round corners are a visually more complicated shape, 
</I>&gt;<i> and therefore I would like to keep the slider look. I particularly like 
</I>&gt;<i> the slider bar look. Only the triangle thumb is giving me trouble.
</I>
I'm fine with the BTab/View, i more meant the slider bar. Maybe the 
edges are to round or the knob is to square. ;)  I have no problem with 
the triangle at all. Oh and i would prefer if we could have the fill 
color enabled be default, at least for Haiku.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 8) BProgressBar, BGroupBox and BMenuBar are splendids!
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I also noticed that some gradients are in fact only composed of two colors. It's very visible on scrollbars, and I'm not sure it's expected.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> No, that is a gloss effect. These gradients are actually composed of 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> four colors, but I may have used too little contrast. I have noticed 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> that the effect is more visible on my very good monitor, and less 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> visible on my laptop. So I may have to tweak the contrast a bit, 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> however, I don't like strong glossy effects too much.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If you change the e.g, B_PANEL_BACKGROUND_COLOR in appearance pref to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> something like yellow, the BTabView looks totally broken.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have tested a bit with changing the main panel bg color, but that was 
</I>&gt;<i> before I got around to the BTabView... :-)
</I>
Well no problem, i know its work in progress.  :)

&gt;<i> Anyways, I am not happy with how that works yet. The current 
</I>&gt;<i> implementation uses a lot of tint_color() around a &quot;base&quot; color. But 
</I>&gt;<i> that is flawed, since the current tints are optimized for the 216 gray. 
</I>&gt;<i> What would work better is to determine the maximum shine and shadow 
</I>&gt;<i> color based on the current bg color and then place all other tints 
</I>&gt;<i> between those. I believe that would give better results to make the 
</I>&gt;<i> maximum shine/shadow colors a fixed (scaled) brightness away from the 
</I>&gt;<i> base color, instead of always tinting between black and white extremes. 
</I>&gt;<i> That will involve some refactoring in BControlLook, but it's something I 
</I>&gt;<i> wanted to do yet.
</I>
Yeah, i wondered anyway why we have to do all this tint stuff. Isn't 
there everything in place to have a defined set of colors to draw a control?
