Originally, the user guide was supposed to be created as a wiki. But for some reason it 
never happened on haiku-os.org, so it was started at haikuware.com. Since using and 
reading their Hiki isn't ideal, it soon wandered directly into SVN.
Right now, with the additional requirement of translations, it goes back to more of a wiki 
approach.
Maybe that will help relieve your dislike.
OTOH, there won't be write permission for everyone as it naturally needs some 
coordination. IMO corrections and additions should be discussed on the doc mailing list.

&gt;<i> For example, there's very little explanation of how to add optional
</I>&gt;<i> packages, or include extra drivers that aren't in the default image,
</I>&gt;<i> no central location that explains building on Mac OSX or Cygwin as

</I>
Philippe Groake is still working on those other platforms. Let's see how it turns out.
I admit that the topic of optional packages and build profiles could be much more 
detailed. But this would quickly turn into more of a buildsystem guide. And though the 
whole installation-from-source business is only temporarily a user guide issue, I think we 
should keep the intended reader in focus.

&gt;<i> It just seems that people stumble across a guide and use it, and then
</I>&gt;<i> land in #haiku when it doesn't work as they expected.
</I>
If a #haiku denizen could collect these FAQs we could see where exactly things need more 
explaining.

This isn't quite the right place for this discussion. The general or doc mailing list 
would be more appropriate. :)

Humdinger
