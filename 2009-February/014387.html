&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks for all the feedback so far! It's interesting how individual 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> points of critique are felt by multiple people, as with the inactive 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tabs distinction. The higher contrast of the BMenuField popup marker 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> was also something Axel mentioned to me before. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Here mine, many shared by others but, oh well:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Inactive tabs are not distinctable, but you know that one, don't you ;-)
</I>
Yes, going to look into that one.

&gt;<i> 2) Inactive tabs extending to a full width dark bar doesn't looks that fine, they're not headers but tabs, and if real world metaphor should applied, tabs don't extend full width. Having full width tabs in a OS cloning the &quot;yellow tabs&quot; BeOS sounds like blasphem, but maybe I'm going religious here :-)
</I>
I intend to keep it this way. I wanted to give the tab view a unique 
feature and move away somewhat from the real-world look. My emphasis was 
on both an appealing/unique look and a very good distinction of the 
active tab. I believe that the look of the active tab helps a lot to 
transport the function of the control. Adjusting the inactive tabs to be 
more tab-like seems like it wouldn't improve this any further, only make 
it less unique.

&gt;<i> 3) Disabled unselected BCheck/RadioButtons looks less disabled than previous look, mostly due to the lighter grey color used to fill box/circle. Could be confusing for visual impaired people.
</I>
Ok, I can tweak that.

&gt;<i> 4) Enabled &amp; selected BRadioButton looks to flat to me. I miss the &quot;ball/LED&quot; R5 effect which was a very distinctive BeOS widget from others GUIs. I hope one could still keep this quite unique visual identity while going to a flatter look...
</I>
Sorry, but I found the ball quite non-stylish and out of place, even 
during the actual BeOS timeframe.

&gt;<i> 5) BMenuField looks too much like a BButton, which can be confusing. But everybody told you so already ;-)
</I>
I would like to keep it this way, but I was thinking to reduce the 
contrast of the outermost edged-in frame. To me, the re-use of certain 
surface looks, like buttons, scrollbars and menufields, help make a 
consistent look.

&gt;<i> 6) Drop shadow of the two kind of BSlider's thumbs are not consistent. I like the rectangular one better, but I can't tell from all widgets what's your choice regarding drop shadows, which could be a sign of inconsistency... or that I'm simply too picky/dumb/old/becoming blind.
</I>
Yes, the triangle thumb was not done. I forgot about that when I commited.

&gt;<i> 7) BSlider bars and active BTab are rounded, when everything else moved from the R5 more rounded look to Haiku's sharper one. This seems inconsistent, and rounding looks dated these days.
</I>
While I was designing, I continually got the feedback that things were 
not round enough. I had hoped to integrate some roundness with this, 
while not making things too inconsistent. I was thinking to also give 
the progress bar round corners like the slider bar to get more consistency.

&gt;<i> 8) BProgressBar, BGroupBox and BMenuBar are splendids!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I also noticed that some gradients are in fact only composed of two colors. It's very visible on scrollbars, and I'm not sure it's expected.
</I>
No, that is a gloss effect. These gradients are actually composed of 
four colors, but I may have used too little contrast. I have noticed 
that the effect is more visible on my very good monitor, and less 
visible on my laptop. So I may have to tweak the contrast a bit, 
however, I don't like strong glossy effects too much.

&gt;<i> But, hey, GUI looks are like everything: it take times to get used to it, and then you can't lives without anymore!
</I>&gt;<i> Please take no offense with the above remarks, taste are very subjective topic, and everyone think he has good one.
</I>
No offense taken! Thanks for the feedback!

&gt;&gt;<i> The code is really WIP, while I 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> felt that the look was already enough of an improvement and complete 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> enough to go ahead and commit the patch. (Besides, it was also getting 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a bit of a pain to keep four Haiku trees on two different computers 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> all in sync... ;-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Isn't what our subversion branches/... root is for? 
</I>&gt;<i> ;-)
</I>
Yeah, probably, but I also didn't want too many people to be able to 
look at something half-finished... ;-)

&gt;<i> Anyway, Stephan, like always, your graphic &quot;touch&quot; is well appreciated. I bet Haiku will have less audience without it: people loves screenshots, and your touch is on everyone but the oldests. ;-)
</I>
Thanks a lot! I have also tried to incorporate some ideas from the 
existing GUI patches, while I wanted to solve some problems that I felt 
myself.

&gt;<i> Philippe, now daddy of 3.
</I>
Wow! Congratulations!

Best regards,
-Stephan
