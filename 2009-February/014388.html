<PRE>Hi Stephan,

great work so far!  :)

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks for all the feedback so far! It's interesting how individual 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> points of critique are felt by multiple people, as with the inactive 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> tabs distinction. The higher contrast of the BMenuField popup marker 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> was also something Axel mentioned to me before. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Here mine, many shared by others but, oh well:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1) Inactive tabs are not distinctable, but you know that one, don't you ;-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, going to look into that one.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2) Inactive tabs extending to a full width dark bar doesn't looks that fine, they're not headers but tabs, and if real world metaphor should applied, tabs don't extend full width. Having full width tabs in a OS cloning the &quot;yellow tabs&quot; BeOS sounds like blasphem, but maybe I'm going religious here :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I intend to keep it this way. I wanted to give the tab view a unique 
</I>&gt;<i> feature and move away somewhat from the real-world look. My emphasis was 
</I>&gt;<i> on both an appealing/unique look and a very good distinction of the 
</I>&gt;<i> active tab. I believe that the look of the active tab helps a lot to 
</I>&gt;<i> transport the function of the control. Adjusting the inactive tabs to be 
</I>&gt;<i> more tab-like seems like it wouldn't improve this any further, only make 
</I>&gt;<i> it less unique.
</I>
Please note the one can use BTab without a BTabView, which then will 
look wired. See for example some of the Data-Translation settings views.

&gt;&gt;<i> 3) Disabled unselected BCheck/RadioButtons looks less disabled than previous look, mostly due to the lighter grey color used to fill box/circle. Could be confusing for visual impaired people.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ok, I can tweak that.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 4) Enabled &amp; selected BRadioButton looks to flat to me. I miss the &quot;ball/LED&quot; R5 effect which was a very distinctive BeOS widget from others GUIs. I hope one could still keep this quite unique visual identity while going to a flatter look...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry, but I found the ball quite non-stylish and out of place, even 
</I>&gt;<i> during the actual BeOS timeframe.
</I>
I fully agree here :)

&gt;&gt;<i> 5) BMenuField looks too much like a BButton, which can be confusing. But everybody told you so already ;-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I would like to keep it this way, but I was thinking to reduce the 
</I>&gt;<i> contrast of the outermost edged-in frame. To me, the re-use of certain 
</I>&gt;<i> surface looks, like buttons, scrollbars and menufields, help make a 
</I>&gt;<i> consistent look.
</I>
I like the new look very much! But please don't forget about the fact 
that a BMenuField can have the fixed length. As you can see in the Mouse 
prefs focus follows mouse thing, long text will draw over the menu field 
arrow area. Also the menu field in Diskprobe is cut off on the right.

&gt;&gt;<i> 6) Drop shadow of the two kind of BSlider's thumbs are not consistent. I like the rectangular one better, but I can't tell from all widgets what's your choice regarding drop shadows, which could be a sign of inconsistency... or that I'm simply too picky/dumb/old/becoming blind.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, the triangle thumb was not done. I forgot about that when I commited.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 7) BSlider bars and active BTab are rounded, when everything else moved from the R5 more rounded look to Haiku's sharper one. This seems inconsistent, and rounding looks dated these days.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> While I was designing, I continually got the feedback that things were 
</I>&gt;<i> not round enough. I had hoped to integrate some roundness with this, 
</I>&gt;<i> while not making things too inconsistent. I was thinking to also give 
</I>&gt;<i> the progress bar round corners like the slider bar to get more consistency.
</I>
I would also vote for less rounded corners, maybe going with 2x2 px edges.

&gt;&gt;<i> 8) BProgressBar, BGroupBox and BMenuBar are splendids!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I also noticed that some gradients are in fact only composed of two colors. It's very visible on scrollbars, and I'm not sure it's expected.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No, that is a gloss effect. These gradients are actually composed of 
</I>&gt;<i> four colors, but I may have used too little contrast. I have noticed 
</I>&gt;<i> that the effect is more visible on my very good monitor, and less 
</I>&gt;<i> visible on my laptop. So I may have to tweak the contrast a bit, 
</I>&gt;<i> however, I don't like strong glossy effects too much.
</I>
If you change the e.g, B_PANEL_BACKGROUND_COLOR in appearance pref to
something like yellow, the BTabView looks totally broken.



Anyway, this was a major step in the right direction! Thanks for the 
hard work.  :)


Regards,
Karsten
