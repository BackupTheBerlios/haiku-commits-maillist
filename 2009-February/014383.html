<PRE>&gt;<i> Thanks for all the feedback so far! It's interesting how individual 
</I>&gt;<i> points of critique are felt by multiple people, as with the inactive 
</I>&gt;<i> tabs distinction. The higher contrast of the BMenuField popup marker 
</I>&gt;<i> was also something Axel mentioned to me before. 
</I>
Here mine, many shared by others but, oh well:

1) Inactive tabs are not distinctable, but you know that one, don't you ;-)

2) Inactive tabs extending to a full width dark bar doesn't looks that fine, they're not headers but tabs, and if real world metaphor should applied, tabs don't extend full width. Having full width tabs in a OS cloning the &quot;yellow tabs&quot; BeOS sounds like blasphem, but maybe I'm going religious here :-)

3) Disabled unselected BCheck/RadioButtons looks less disabled than previous look, mostly due to the lighter grey color used to fill box/circle. Could be confusing for visual impaired people.

4) Enabled &amp; selected BRadioButton looks to flat to me. I miss the &quot;ball/LED&quot; R5 effect which was a very distinctive BeOS widget from others GUIs. I hope one could still keep this quite unique visual identity while going to a flatter look...

5) BMenuField looks too much like a BButton, which can be confusing. But everybody told you so already ;-)

6) Drop shadow of the two kind of BSlider's thumbs are not consistent. I like the rectangular one better, but I can't tell from all widgets what's your choice regarding drop shadows, which could be a sign of inconsistency... or that I'm simply too picky/dumb/old/becoming blind.

7) BSlider bars and active BTab are rounded, when everything else moved from the R5 more rounded look to Haiku's sharper one. This seems inconsistent, and rounding looks dated these days.

8) BProgressBar, BGroupBox and BMenuBar are splendids!

I also noticed that some gradients are in fact only composed of two colors. It's very visible on scrollbars, and I'm not sure it's expected.

But, hey, GUI looks are like everything: it take times to get used to it, and then you can't lives without anymore!
Please take no offense with the above remarks, taste are very subjective topic, and everyone think he has good one.

&gt;<i> The code is really WIP, while I 
</I>&gt;<i> felt that the look was already enough of an improvement and complete 
</I>&gt;<i> enough to go ahead and commit the patch. (Besides, it was also getting 
</I>&gt;<i> a bit of a pain to keep four Haiku trees on two different computers 
</I>&gt;<i> all in sync... ;-)
</I>
Isn't what our subversion branches/... root is for? 
;-)

Anyway, Stephan, like always, your graphic &quot;touch&quot; is well appreciated. I bet Haiku will have less audience without it: people loves screenshots, and your touch is on everyone but the oldests. ;-)

Regards,

Philippe, now daddy of 3.
