I think my current dislike for the &quot;guides&quot; and &quot;forum posts&quot; is that
there's no collaborative location where people can improve on the
instructions and add information for other platforms and
configurations.

For example, there's very little explanation of how to add optional
packages, or include extra drivers that aren't in the default image,
no central location that explains building on Mac OSX or Cygwin as
well as Linux, nor is there much information on build profiles, etc.
It just seems that people stumble across a guide and use it, and then
land in #haiku when it doesn't work as they expected.

I'd personally prefer a wiki that anyone can edit for this type of
documentation, with collaborative, centralized, multi-page content. At
that point, I'd recommend going back to every guide or forum post and
place a giant link at the top pointing to the wiki content.

Often times, there is some small bit of advice that is given when
someone is reading the guide and trying to make it work on their own
environment (like for example, 64bit arch linux)... the situation
screams wiki to me.
