That's a very good point! I didn't know about the screenshot feature on 
Windows for a long time, and I occasionally took some unintended 
screenshots in BeOS, when I accidently hit the Print key.
I like the private clipboard idea, too, but I don't know how long they 
are preserved; maybe it would be better to pass the data directly to 
the app, so that not too much memory is wasted (although the screenshot 
app could probably also simply delete it afterwards). And this also 
solves the potential problem that you need to access the disk before 
actually taking the shot.

The current window (which triggers the screenshot) could then also pass 
its current location and size to the screenshot app, so that you could 
then decide in the screenshot app wether or not the whole screen or 
just the active window should be saved.

Well, you two managed to convince me, thanks :-)
But what's Ryan's opinion who wanted to actually implement it?

Bye,
   Axel.
