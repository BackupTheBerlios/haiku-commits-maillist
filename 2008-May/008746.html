I think GIt's usabiity has improved a lot recently. I certainly don't
find it that hard. In fact it is very similar to svn, minus all the
disadvantages of svn.

You don't have to worry about who has commit access or not. People can
work fairly independently with Git and then merge work with much less
trouble than svn.

Branches are cheap and easy, so that even small changes can be done on
branches and then merged back. This means you can stop in the middle
of your work and go back to the main branch to fix a small bug in the
area you are working without the old svn hacks of having to save a
backup of your current work and then &quot;svn revert&quot; to get back to the
original. I hate doing that, but that is just what you have to do with
Subversion. Git even has a special command &quot;git stash&quot; that does that
kind of operation for you if you aren't in a special branch.

History is tracked between branches and merges so you can see the true
history of a file.

File moves are tracked properly and automatically.

You can browse the history without hitting the server. You can commit
without hitting the server. You can have source code on multiple
machines that are both used for development without having to resort
to copying files around by hand (Git can pull or push to the multiple
repos you have on each machine.)

Git is its own backup system, since each person has a full copy of the
repo. I'd love to see what would happen if Berlios lost Haiku's SVN
repo. Hopefully that won't happen, but how sure can we be? In that
case the irony would be that the history of Haiku would be saved by
Git because Rene and other people have a Git clone of Haiku SVN repo
with all the history.

Git is also very efficient. The entire repo for Haiku with all the
history fits in about 220 MB (not checked out.)

&gt;<i> It certainly blows BerliOS limits quite a bit, but I don't really know
</I>&gt;<i> what you mean by unmanageable.
</I>
As Rene says, doing anything with Berlios from the US is a huge pain.
Of course you European folks don't see that, but that doesn't mean it
isn't there ;)

But even besides that, the repo is just huge, so that svn update, or
God forbid, checking out all the code again, takes inordinate amounts
of time. The more we keep adding stuff &quot;just in case&quot;, or because it
is the easiest thing, the worse it gets. Moving to Git would probably
help, but it sounds like that won't ever happen. So at least for my
own projects I am using Git.
