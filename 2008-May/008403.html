You seem to have missed this message...

Modifier keys do wonders, don't they? :)

&gt;<i> If you're

</I>&gt;<i> for whatever reason, that's precisely the kind of case where something
</I>&gt;<i> like a batch converter would be a good thing, unless you think picking

</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
I did say &quot;multiple screenshots,&quot; but I certainly did not mean 100 
screenshots; I was thinking more along the lines of a few screenshots, 
which would probably be the most common case. For the extreme cases such 
as the one you bring up, it would be nice if one could come up with a 
way for Haiku to somehow remember what format you want, as that would 
make the batch processor unnecessary. Wouldn't that be nice? (I realize 
this is R2 stuff though.)

And even if we were talking about taking only one screenshot, I would 
still prefer the *option* of invoking a popup menu at the time of taking 
the screenshot rather than having to go through a multiple step process 
of opening the captured file in yet another app and making multiple 
mouse movements/clicks to save it in the format that I want/need. :)

Cheers,

Koki
