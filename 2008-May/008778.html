That all sounds very nice, but I still don't see why it has to be Git 
for this project other than your personal preference. Which is fine, of 
course :-)

&gt;<i> Git is its own backup system, since each person has a full copy of 
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> repo. I'd love to see what would happen if Berlios lost Haiku's SVN
</I>&gt;<i> repo. Hopefully that won't happen, but how sure can we be? In that
</I>&gt;<i> case the irony would be that the history of Haiku would be saved by
</I>&gt;<i> Git because Rene and other people have a Git clone of Haiku SVN repo
</I>&gt;<i> with all the history.
</I>
I and others periodically download the full repository from BerliOS - 
just in case. But yours is probably more up to date.

&gt;<i> Git is also very efficient. The entire repo for Haiku with all the
</I>&gt;<i> history fits in about 220 MB (not checked out.)
</I>
That's indeed pretty impressive; the SVN repo I periodically get from 
BerliOS ways in about 400 MB.
 
&gt;<i> &gt; It certainly blows BerliOS limits quite a bit, but I don't really 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; know
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; what you mean by unmanageable.
</I>&gt;<i> As Rene says, doing anything with Berlios from the US is a huge pain.
</I>&gt;<i> Of course you European folks don't see that, but that doesn't mean it
</I>&gt;<i> isn't there ;)
</I>
Okay, but that probably wouldn't go away if we switched to a Git server 
- as the bandwidth and responsiveness is usually limited by the server 
location and configuration.

&gt;<i> But even besides that, the repo is just huge, so that svn update, or
</I>&gt;<i> God forbid, checking out all the code again, takes inordinate amounts
</I>&gt;<i> of time. The more we keep adding stuff &quot;just in case&quot;, or because it
</I>&gt;<i> is the easiest thing, the worse it gets.
</I>
A full checkout definitely takes some time (even though it's usually 
way less than an hour here), but &quot;svn update&quot; is pretty fast as long as 
I'm not using BeOS; it only takes a couple of seconds compared to 
several minutes on BeOS :-)

&gt;<i> Moving to Git would probably
</I>&gt;<i> help, but it sounds like that won't ever happen. So at least for my
</I>&gt;<i> own projects I am using Git.
</I>
I don't know if that never happens, but I think using git-svn is a good 
compromise for now; we could even host such a repository on our 
servers. It's just that I don't see the need to have more than one 
repository as long as that's available (which is obviously no real 
problem in Europe).
And I definitely prefer rXXX revisions over how Git identifies a 
revision - that makes very clear what revision a specific release uses, 
and can be compared easily.

Bye,
   Axel.
