I have found some nice research that shows you are wrong on this one. 
Redundant paranthesis do help to make the code more readible and lessen the 
chance for mistakes:

&lt;<A HREF="http://www.knosof.co.uk/cbook/accu06a.pdf">http://www.knosof.co.uk/cbook/accu06a.pdf</A>&gt;

It shows that developers have a likeliness of 33% to guess wrong at 
operator precedence across all operators in relation to the average 
occurance of a particular operator.

--- Excerpt from the Conclusion ---
Developer training is unlikely to be a viable option for solving the 
problem of faults caused by incorrect knowledge of operator pair 
precedence. While it is possible for people to learn the precedence of all 
language
operators suffiently well to pass a test, this knowledge will degrade over 
time through lack of use. Many languages contain operators that are rarely 
used in practice and it is knowledge of the precedence of these operators 
that developers are likely to forget the quickest (through of lack of 
practice).
While coding guideline often contain a recommendation specifying that 
operator precedence be made explicit through the use of parenthesis, 
experience shows that developers are often loath to insert what they 
consider to be redundant parenthesis (because &#8220;Everybody knows what the 
precedence is and if they don&#8217;t they should not be working on this code&#8221;). 
Subject operator pair performance should be all the evidence needed to 
convince people that redundant parenthesis do provide a useful service. 
Under 2% of all expressions would need to make use of redundant parenthesis.
---

And this does not even take into account the fact that the code snipped in 
question was not only about operator precedence, but also about clearing up 
implicit integer range expansion, or whatever this was called.

So I while I was originally in defense of this change because I can 
sympathise, I would now even go as far as putting a recommendation for 
redundant use of paranthesis into our coding guide lines. :-)

Best regards,
-Stephan
