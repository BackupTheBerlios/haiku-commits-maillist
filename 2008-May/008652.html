We shouldn't be that far away... the only obvious missing thing is the 
alt graphics charset (there seems to be some code from MuTerm already), 
which Be's Terminal never supported.
This is why every curses app look ugly in BeOS, because they either use 
+---+ or think it's enabled and send lqqqp... or even undisplayables.
In theory UTF-8 has all those already, but they are in a range 
expressed with more than 1 byte. And of course termcap descriptions 
handles remapping them but only to 1 byte + a start and end sequence. 
So we can't have it send UTF-8 for that (maybe recent libs have that 
fixed ?).

Still, some features depart from xterm and others, as I said like VPA 
and HPA, where we say we take the arg +1.
Should be easy to #ifdef BETERM_SUPPORT though, or even have a setting.

Ideally we would extend the termcap description, or provide a haiku 
one, which mean we can even add some funky features to ease integration 
into the GUI, but that would only end up in our own termcap, not that 
of all the existing OSes, including R5.

</I>&gt;<i> ;-
</I>&gt;<i> ))
</I>
Didn't it ? What was wrong with it ?
Didn't test it recently, no.
I would have tested xemacs -nw but I can't yet.
Oh dear I'll zip you up the 100MB stuff needed to dump it and let you 
debug BFS :P

Fran&#231;ois.
