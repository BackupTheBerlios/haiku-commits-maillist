</I>
Ok, I've checked the BeOS Terminal behavior:

* It does not have an internal clipboard for the selection.
* Which also means you cannot copy text across Terminal windows using the 
middle/right mouse button (!).
* /If/ text is selected in a Terminal window, that text has precedence over 
the system clipboard. Like if you have text selected, that is pasted. If 
you unselect it, then suddenly the system clipboard text is pasted without 
any further action.

The above could be regarded as consistent behaviour. However, the missing 
cross Terminal mouse pasting is a major drawback. This *can* only be fixed 
by some kind of internal additional cross-Terminal clipboard, for the 
simple reason that just selecting something in Terminal should not already 
replace the contents of the system clipboard, so it has to be an internal 
one. If you then invoke the copy shortcut, it obviously goes into the 
system clipboard.

But the internal clipboard feature means that the Terminal where you have 
last selected something will have modified the internal clipboard, so even 
if you still have a selection in another Terminal, it would not be in the 
internal clipboard anymore. A possibility would be to deselect in all the 
other Terminals as soon as you select in one Terminal. That again would be 
highly annoying.

For all those reasons, I believe that the solution I have found is the best 
one considering all features that one wants to have and the respective side 
effects. It means that:

* Selecting something in any Terminal modifies the cross Terminal internal 
clipboard. The last selected text wins.
* This already introduces the decoupling of visible selection and current 
clipboard.
* When you invoke the copy shortcut in any other application, or the 
Terminal itself (!), then that text always also replaces the internal cross 
Terminal clipboard.

This behaviour is also consistent, it simply means that the last copied 
text is always available in the clipboard.

Best regards,
-Stephan
