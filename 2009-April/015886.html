Why shouldn't it be possible to check a FS when it is mounted with a layer 
on top of it?

&gt;<i> &gt; IMHO, the function is way too fragile. And given that its apparent
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; purpose is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to solve a BFS only problem, I'd suggest to rather keep a list of

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It should be a problem for all file systems supporting the checkfs
</I>&gt;<i> functionality.
</I>
Maybe I misunderstood the original problem, but I thought it was that BFS 
doesn't know about a node anymore as soon as it has been removed from its 
directory. I don't know the internals of many file system, but it seems at 
least unlikely that those supporting hard links share this property.

&gt;<i> We could make it more efficient by always moving removed nodes to the
</I>&gt;<i> head of the list, and then stop when retrieving the first non-removed
</I>&gt;<i> entry.
</I>
Asserting again that the file system would be responsible for preventing 
any activity to disrupt the list order, this would work.

&gt;<i> I don't really like to waste 8 bytes for every Inode for the
</I>&gt;<i> list link just because of this efficiency problem
</I>
The two obvious solutions are: (1) not to use an invasive list (given that 
removed vnodes usually don't last very long, there shouldn't be that many 
anyway), or (2) to reuse Inode fields that aren't used when the node has 
been removed.

CU, Ingo
