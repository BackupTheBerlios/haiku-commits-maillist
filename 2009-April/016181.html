Pretty cool! That's done it for the remaining computer that couldn't boot 
from the CD here. I've so far tested with 5 different computers, the sixth 
is an Intel Mac Mini, but I don't know what steps BootCamp will take when I 
try to boot from a CD (will it resize the MacOS partition without asking?)

Two of the computers had a pretty hard time booting from the CD. One took 
about 30 minutes, the other about 40. The one that took really long has an 
SATA Blue-Ray drive. Although when booting Haiku from it's harddrive, the 
SATA driver is never in use, it seemed it still booted using the new ATA 
bus_manager (I specifically endured the pain until I could look at 
DriveSetup and see the device paths, but of course I cannot remember now, 
even though it's only two days ago... I think it was /dev/disk/atapi... but 
not 100% sure). When trying to boot this computer (from CD) using the old 
IDE bus_manager, it encountered an interrupt storm on the line for IDE. 
There were no other drivers on that line (16). With the new bus_manager it 
worked (definitely without interrupt storm, I checked), but insanely slow. 
The other computer that booted slow is my main Haiku work machine. It seems 
that the new ATA bus_manager has problems on this machine yet (Marvel IDE 
chip, ASUS P5Q board), when I insert a CD, the drive makes a funny low purr 
and the machine locks up. As I said, it still booted eventually from the 
same CD-drive, though. It seemed to me like the drive LED was flashing 
about once per second and the Installer screen appeared about 30 minutes 
later.

I can make a boot CD with ATA tracing enabled. What should I look out for? 
(I have no serial cable to simply copy all the output.)

Oh, and thanks for all the hard work, Michael!

Best regards,
-Stephan
