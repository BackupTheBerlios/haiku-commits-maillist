I was at least aware of that. But since this function should only be 
interesting in the context of checkfs, I did not care about that.

&gt;<i> * There's a specific race condition: Between locker.Unlock() and

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * There's a general race condition: The node could be unremoved at

</I>&gt;<i> so a returned node might not really be removed anymore.
</I>
Since that is always going through the file system, this race condition 
does only exist if the FS allows it. The same would be true for 
get_vnode_removed() -- it's always in the file system's responsibility 
to do that.

&gt;<i> * fs_mount::rlock is held while dec_vnode_ref_count() is called.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * Iterating through all of the volume's nodes isn't particularly 
</I>&gt;<i> efficient.
</I>
Indeed.

&gt;<i> IMHO, the function is way too fragile. And given that its apparent 
</I>&gt;<i> purpose is 
</I>&gt;<i> to solve a BFS only problem, I'd suggest to rather keep a list of 
</I>&gt;<i> removed 
</I>&gt;<i> nodes in BFS itself and remove this function again.
</I>
It should be a problem for all file systems supporting the checkfs 
functionality.

We could make it more efficient by always moving removed nodes to the 
head of the list, and then stop when retrieving the first non-removed 
entry. I don't really like to waste 8 bytes for every Inode for the 
list link just because of this efficiency problem -- after all, this is 
not a commonly used function, but has it's place in checkfs 
functionality only.

In any case, I'll fix the problems you found, thanks!

Bye,
   Axel.
