To be honest, I am pretty disappointed at how this discussion ended up. 
I've tried to base this on technical facts, but it has become all about how 
it makes David feel. Of course I didn't want it to end up making David feel 
bad, but thanks for asserting my feelings are not important (for example 
when I work on Clockwerk or MediaPlayer, which rely on the MediaKit). 
That's exactly why I wanted to keep emotions out of it and discuss on 
technical terms. Jorge, do you have any idea how much ported code there is 
in Haiku? Sure, there is tons of code we've written ourselves, but do you 
really have any idea about what the ballance truely is? And how come you 
assert that &quot;writing yourself&quot; means &quot;optimal&quot;? That's exactly what you do 
above and of course it makes what I tried to propose look bad in comparison 
(i.e. no discussion on technical terms, but on spreading assertions without 
causal connection).

If this is how we are going to &quot;discuss&quot; any random future change in Haiku, 
then thank you, but without me. I can just make my five lines patch in 
FFmpeg (without commiting it) and be done with it.

David, if it wasn't clear from all the mails we exchanged, also privately, 
I admire your work and you helped me out in desperate situations. This was 
really not about questioning your work or how long it takes you or what you 
spend your time on. I simply proposed making a five lines patch and put a 
checkmark behind something to free up resources for other things (yours and 
mine). If it wasn't clear, I would love you to work on the OggReader, I was 
merely trying to discuss what options we have and what the respective 
benefits would be.

Best regards,
-Stephan
