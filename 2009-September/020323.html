This is actually a pretty good idea. +1 from me.

I guess the reason not many people use indexes (yeah, I just got this 
statistic completely out of the blue, which gives it a 60% chance of 
being more correct than formal ones) is because there is no easy way to 
use them (it is basically a command line interface only). Maybe we 
should try to expose this to the user in a way that it would be both 
easy to use and that would actually take care f house-keeping 
automatically (like reindexing files).
