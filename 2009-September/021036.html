</I>&gt;&gt;<i> FWIW, I for one greatly appreciate the love that you are giving to the

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ported solutions. So, please, keep on working on this native stuff and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> supporting users that have taken the time to report bugs and do testing 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (I have seen this in numerous instances on Trac).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And don't worry if it takes you longer than others may expect. Haiku has

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there is an alpha release out there.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To be honest, I am pretty disappointed at how this discussion ended up.

</I>&gt;<i> bad, but thanks for asserting my feelings are not important (for example 
</I>&gt;<i> when I work on Clockwerk or MediaPlayer, which rely on the MediaKit). 
</I>&gt;<i> That's exactly why I wanted to keep emotions out of it and discuss on 
</I>&gt;<i> technical terms. Jorge, do you have any idea how much ported code there is 
</I>&gt;<i> in Haiku? Sure, there is tons of code we've written ourselves, but do you 
</I>&gt;<i> really have any idea about what the ballance truely is? And how come you 
</I>&gt;<i> assert that &quot;writing yourself&quot; means &quot;optimal&quot;? That's exactly what you do 
</I>&gt;<i> above and of course it makes what I tried to propose look bad in comparison 
</I>&gt;<i> (i.e. no discussion on technical terms, but on spreading assertions without 
</I>&gt;<i> causal connection).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If this is how we are going to &quot;discuss&quot; any random future change in Haiku, 
</I>&gt;<i> then thank you, but without me. I can just make my five lines patch in 
</I>&gt;<i> FFmpeg (without commiting it) and be done with it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> David, if it wasn't clear from all the mails we exchanged, also privately, 
</I>&gt;<i> I admire your work and you helped me out in desperate situations. This was 
</I>&gt;<i> really not about questioning your work or how long it takes you or what you 
</I>&gt;<i> spend your time on. I simply proposed making a five lines patch and put a 
</I>&gt;<i> checkmark behind something to free up resources for other things (yours and 
</I>&gt;<i> mine). If it wasn't clear, I would love you to work on the OggReader, I was 
</I>&gt;<i> merely trying to discuss what options we have and what the respective 
</I>&gt;<i> benefits would be.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
Sorry Stippi, but I did not mean to diminish the value your effort, or 
that of others for that matter, nor to question your judgement on 
technical grounds. I was just trying to...

1) Give some words of support to someone who was feeling (or at least 
seemed) that his effort was not being appreciated.

2) Raise the flag on what I see as a temptation for replacing native 
stuff with ported solutions. As well integrated and as nice to have in 
the short run these ported solutions may be (which I agree they can be 
in certain cases), I think it is a dangerous double sword that makes it 
less compelling to work on native solutions, therefore perpetuating the 
problem of lack of resources. I would not expect newcomers to take upon 
native stuff if the core developers do not eat their own dog food, if 
you understand what I mean. :)

I regret that my response caused the reaction that it did on your part, 
but I would really appreciate if you could give me the space to express 
my opinions/views, even if you thought they were  
mistaken/wrong/nuts/whatever (which could well be the case). :)

Regards,

Jorge/aka Koki
