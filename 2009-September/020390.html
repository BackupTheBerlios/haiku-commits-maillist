</I>&gt;<i> &gt;

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; version compiled from trunk or just compile People from it and use with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the alpha branch installation.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>
I quickly read through the patch and only spotted incorrectly indented 
&quot;break&quot;s and a missing, but harmless, &quot;break&quot; in a loop, so I tend to agree, 
but...

&gt;<i> it would only affect Peolpe and only in a
</I>&gt;<i> circumstance in which it was arguably broken before.
</I>
... this assumption is just wrong. It is quite easy to introduce crashes, 
memory corruptions or leaks, infinite loops, etc. and those might not just 
be triggered in circumstances that were broken before. By claiming shared 
global resources infinite loops and memory leaks actually affect the whole 
system.

&gt;<i> So for new features where the side effects are hard to judge, I am
</I>&gt;<i> absolutely with Ingo, but for something like this, I would argue it would
</I>&gt;<i> be nice to have in the alpha and the risk of breaking something by
</I>&gt;<i> including it is pretty much zero. I wouldn't exclude such nice finishing
</I>&gt;<i> touches just for the sake of being consequent. After all, we wanted to give
</I>&gt;<i> the best possible first impression with this release.
</I>
Sure we do. We also want to establish a working release process to use in 
the future. And while a probably harmless, some 100 lines &quot;nice finishing 
touch&quot; feature patch six days before an alpha release may sound OK, the same 
patch a few hours before a final release certainly does not sound OK to me.

So where to draw the line? Well, exactly when the feature freeze was called. 
The whole point of the feature freeze is to prevent new code, which always 
has the potential for bugs, to be introduced into a tested code base. Any 
finishing touch features should be added before the feature freeze -- I 
guess it simply was upon us a bit too sudden.

Which is why I think the following changes to the process for the next 
release would be reasonable:

* After creating the release branch allow for &quot;polishing period&quot; before 
feature freezing the branch.

* The release manager should be elected and should have total authority over 
the branch. I.e. he/she decides what goes in and what doesn't.

Good for you. I certainly don't, unless the rule is that non-bugfix patches 
are never accepted. Excellent example nonetheless -- common sense being 
&quot;common&quot; is probably just as much a delusion as obscenity being perceived 
the same by all people.

CU, Ingo
