<PRE>Hi guys,

Maybe such thread, as interested as it could be, should be moved on
haiku-developement or even Media Kit ML, no?

&gt;<i> Please don't put colour conversion at the decoder or encoder level.
</I>&gt;<i> It is something that has to be done at the media kit level so it is
</I>&gt;<i> available for everything to use.
</I>
I agree with David here.
I even think we should have some auto-assembly mechanism in media kit
that would automagically
build a connection path between a video producer and a video
consummer, like GStreamer or Apple's CoreImage does.
And like we have for audio formats, thanks to Mixer node that is able
to convert from/to pretty much any audio format.
We miss this kind of support for video format, and it's not great that
consumer node (encoder include) should each have their own
colorspace conversion. Or worse, poor/limited one.

Anyway...

&gt;<i> Once we switch to using ffmpeg for all our media needs, I very much
</I>&gt;<i> doubt someone will come along and work on anything else.
</I>
Good point. One risk is indeed that our media plugin API skills will
drop among Haiku developers.
Considering the few people having such skills today, that's a valid
threat on our open-sourced &quot;Media OS&quot;.

Another point is ffmpeg footprint. It's quite a do-everything add-on.
Which sounds like the opposite of a modular/add-on design.

&gt;<i> Well it is simple enough I suppose, I don't have any more time
</I>&gt;<i> available so if my efforts are not enough to let you make whatever
</I>&gt;<i> your deadlines are then just tell me to step aside and I will.
</I>
Guys, please don't overreact. We're all doing our best. Well, at least
you both are ;-)
AFAIK, Haiku R1 deadline is still &quot;when it's ready&quot;, and that signal
will be set by nobody but its developers, as we did for alpha1.

However, balancing features addition rate, with several foreign code
reuse, and an high level skills is one risk we should manage, in
particular since alpha1 release (raise users expectation) and the new
developers joining us recently.
We should not fall in NIH (Not *Implemented* Here) syndrome, but we
should also not lost our goal in mind, one being having an high
quality system-wide media framework, which include a good plugin API
too, well enough abstracted that we could easily wrap or write
ourselves any media codec in the future without refactoring it each
time, *and* developers enough skilled to do it. My feeling is that's
today the case, and I guess that because this API was not design with
ffmpeg wrapping in mind.
But the media kit skilled developers didn't reach its critical mass
yet, indeed...

Oh well. If I knew before that my libtheora little upgrade will
trigger such debate on media plugins future strategy, I will have...
still do it.
Because that's me, typical. :-)

Bye,
  Philippe.
