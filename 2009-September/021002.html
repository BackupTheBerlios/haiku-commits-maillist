</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I don't understand what you mean. My concern is with manageable code as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; well. Compared to the code that wraps around the Xiph codecs in our
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; repository, our FFmpeg wrapper is very little code. I consider that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; more manageable. So I was looking for other compelling arguments.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We could just drop the whole plugin concept and use ffmpeg for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> everything. &#160;There is no plugin we have that ffmpeg has not got covered.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Where do we draw the line?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To be honest, I see this more practical. IMHO, the plugin concept is nice,
</I>&gt;<i> we should definitely keep that. But that doesn't mean we can't drop most of
</I>&gt;<i> the plugins if there is a more maintainable way to support all those
</I>&gt;<i> formats and codecs. To give a concrete example, I am having problems with
</I>&gt;<i> some .wmv files I tested with
</I>
Ticket No?  :-)

&gt;<i>, and by switching to the ASF demuxer in
</I>&gt;<i> FFmpeg, all the problems go away. Can you give me a good reason why I
</I>&gt;<i> should dig into the ASF demuxer code to find the problems when I have a
</I>&gt;<i> much simpler solution right in front of me? Haiku is not about maintaining
</I>&gt;<i> two code-bases for the very same purpose. I just don't see the point of it
</I>&gt;<i> and until now, I have not heard a good argument pro maintaining our own
</I>&gt;<i> codec and demuxer implementations, especially when all but two maintainers
</I>&gt;<i> have pretty much no time for Haiku anymore.
</I>
That same argument could be used for why are we building Haiku at all
or the MediaPlayer app when we have VLC.

I like programming Haiku because I get to learn about media formats
and codecs and the like and right now I seem to be the only person
doing anything with that part of the system.  I wrote a SSE2
conversion routine for Haiku recently, it was difficult but rewarding.
 I learnt a lot and Haiku video got to be faster on VESA machines.

Yes, i don't have enough time to do everything or even enough
knowledge to be able to but we have that problem all over Haiku

We need more developers and I think it is easier for a new developer
to step up and work on our codebase and get changes done than it will
be for someone to make changes to ffmpeg.

&gt;<i> Please don't take this the wrong way, but all that was obvious to me. What
</I>&gt;<i> I am wondering is why there is libogg as well as -- as it seems -- our own
</I>&gt;<i> code replicating it. I saw places in the code that had a comment &quot;copied
</I>&gt;<i> from this and that in libogg&quot;. But I may be missing something.
</I>
I don't know either, I just glanced through the code looking for why
video was not supported.

&gt;&gt;<i> The Ogg reader code seems more complex but I don't know anything about
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the ogg container format to decide.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The original author looks to have created a track subclass for each type
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of stream available in the container.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So to fix the issue raised we just need to create a new subclass for the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> missing codec.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So you are saying we are better off when you (or someone else) spends his
</I>&gt;<i> valuable time to try to dig into the OggReader source code to add the
</I>&gt;<i> missing features, as well as fixing any issues that may pop up, when all we
</I>&gt;<i> have to do is configure FFmpeg with Ogg support and be done with it?
</I>&gt;<i> Especially when that would also take care of encoding for free?
</I>
Well, it is my time to spend.  There is not much else in Haiku that
interests me so I doubt I would do much else.

&gt;<i> It may seem like I have made up my own opinion on this subject, but I am
</I>&gt;<i> actually trying to hear good arguments pro keeping the code we have. After
</I>&gt;<i> all, it was hard work to create it. That a lot of the maintainers don't
</I>&gt;<i> have time to keep working on their code is one thing. But if there are no
</I>&gt;<i> other compelling arguments, like for example the Haiku code is
</I>&gt;<i> multi-threaded, while FFmpeg is not... (which is not the case), or other
</I>&gt;<i> technical reasons, I just don't see the point.
</I>
There is no argument, we need developers.  If we can attract
developers who are interested in writing and maintaining media code
then we should have the code.  If we cannot then we just become
another user of ffmpeg.

Certainly the last thing Haiku needs is to rely on me fixing Media issues.

David
