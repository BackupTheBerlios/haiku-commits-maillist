<PRE>Hi David,

On 2009-09-30 at 11:39:59 [+0200], David McPaul &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/haiku-commits">dlmcpaul at gmail.com</A>&gt; wrote:

Ok, no worries! Thanks for saying that.

&gt;<i> I doubt there is any particular technical reason why we could not just

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> However, I have alway felt that the original media design was for each 
</I>&gt;<i> format and codec to be a seperate add-on so each piece could be replaced 
</I>&gt;<i> with a better version if a user needed to.
</I>
That's certainly true. Although a plugin which can run internal sub-plugins 
on the same probedata has a performance advantage against many plugins 
being loaded and each reading the probe data again. Of course we can change 
the mechanism to read the probe data only once and provide it to each 
plugin in turn, with the plugin optionally reading more. But there is still 
more overhead because of loading the plugins. It's ok if there are few, but 
if you want to support as many formats as FFmpeg does, it may become 
noticable.

&gt;<i> So my preference has always been to create individual add-ons either from 
</I>&gt;<i> scratch (mp4/mov) or by using an existing library that I thought suitable 
</I>&gt;<i> (asf).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This approach is always going to be limited by the amount of time people 
</I>&gt;<i> have to fix any bugs found and I had hoped that new developers would come 
</I>&gt;<i> along who found a seperate add-on easier to understand and help with.  
</I>&gt;<i> That has not been the case so far and so I have been left as the Haiku 
</I>&gt;<i> media person.  This is not a role I am comfortable with as I am more an 
</I>&gt;<i> interested amateur than an expert in media coding.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For now though, where we do have code written I would like the 
</I>&gt;<i> opportunity to fix bugs instead of passing that responsibility to the 
</I>&gt;<i> ffmpeg project.
</I>
Ok, I can create a ticket for the issue I am seeing. Maybe we could even 
compare the chunk sizes that the ASF plugin respectively the FFmpeg plugin 
give for the same stream. The problem seems to be with keyframes, but only 
for certain files. I can probably upload one or find the link where I 
downloaded it.

Best regards,
-Stephan
