Yeah, except that when confronted with a decision between consistency 
and style, I will always go with consistency. The reason for this is 
very evident if you happen to work in different projects with different 
styles. You will not use the style you think is best but the one that is 
more consistent.

&gt;<i> Of course, that patch should ideally be accompanied with a further

</I>
OTOH, until someone actually does that, the code will be an even greater 
mess than it is now and this does not help anyone reading it. My point 
is, if some of us decide to rewrite MDR to fit the style (which I intend 
to do at some point, component by component) it is fine. What is not 
fine nor reasonable is to reject a very useful patch on the grounds that 
it does not follow our coding guidelines when the file it touches does 
not follow the guidelines either.

In fact, this creates a conundrum. Right now I am rewriting IMAP and 
that will, of course, follow our coding guidelines. OTOH, I have several 
bugs to fix that were reported in the bug tracker and although I am 
willing to work on then, if I have to rewrite every file that I touch so 
it follows the style I will most definitely postpone the changes for 
when I have a lot more free time than I do now. In this case, what is 
more important? Getting the bugs fixed or making sure every file follows 
the coding style? (that was a rhetorical question, BTW. At least I have 
no doubts about what is more important).
