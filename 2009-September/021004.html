</I>&gt;<i> &gt; To be honest, I see this more practical. IMHO, the plugin concept is

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; most of 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the plugins if there is a more maintainable way to support all those 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; formats and codecs. To give a concrete example, I am having problems 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; some .wmv files I tested with, and by switching to the ASF demuxer in 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; FFmpeg, all the problems go away. Can you give me a good reason why I 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; should dig into the ASF demuxer code to find the problems when I have a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; much simpler solution right in front of me? Haiku is not about 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; maintaining 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; two code-bases for the very same purpose. I just don't see the point of 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and until now, I have not heard a good argument pro maintaining our own 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; codec and demuxer implementations, especially when all but two 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; maintainers 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have pretty much no time for Haiku anymore.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> IMO, for codecs, we should always use existing implementations where 
</I>&gt;<i> possible due to their complexity alone. For (de)muxer, I would usually 
</I>&gt;<i> prefer using an official library if such exists (for maximum 
</I>&gt;<i> compatibility), if the license fits, or even writing it ourselves if 
</I>&gt;<i> someone enjoys it :-)
</I>
Agreed. As long as it has equal quality and it is maintained.

&gt;<i> Other than that, I think it's always up to the future maintainer of the 
</I>&gt;<i> code to decide whether or not to keep/replace a certain piece of 
</I>&gt;<i> software. If Stephan is not interested in maintaining our ASF demuxer, 
</I>&gt;<i> why shouldn't he use the one of ffmpeg? But if we have a maintainer for 
</I>&gt;<i> it, who makes sure bugs are fixed, why should we use ffmpeg for that?
</I>
Since the maintainer is working on many different things anyway, he can use 
the free time to work on something else, which cannot be so easily fixed by 
re-using existing code.

&gt;<i> Using VLC vs. our own MediaPlayer is actually a different problem, 
</I>&gt;<i> because all applications using the Media Kit will benefit from good and 
</I>&gt;<i> many codecs; the work we bury there pays off at many fronts.
</I>
That wouldn't even be my argument. I think there is simply a different 
level of complexity. A media player is sufficiently complex that it 
interests me how it works and how I can use it. At a certain level, it's 
just about watching a movie, but anyone who has used a media player knows 
that there is more to it and the experience can be better or worse. At the 
level of the whole operating system, it is even more the case, and there is 
so many details that influence this, that helping to create Haiku is 
totally worth it to me. However, demuxing a video file and decoding a 
stream is something very, very low-level. Comparing that to Haiku is like 
comparing stones to houses.

Best regards,
-Stephan
