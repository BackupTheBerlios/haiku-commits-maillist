&gt;<i> when I was working on this in the train today, I also came across this warning. I had a GCC2 development environment there, I don't remember if GCC4 also gave a warning or not. In any case, I believe the destructor needs to be declared virtual in the base class, not in the inherited class, no? The warning is about the problem, that when delete is called on a pointer to the base class, that then the destructor of the real class is not called, since the base class destructor is not declared virtual. This problem would still exist if you fix the warning like above, unless I am missing something.

This is correct, but you are missing one piece of the puzzle: Whenever 
you create a class it can, potentially, be the base class of a 
hypothetical derived class. Even if it also derives from other class. 
This warning is about this fact (that if derived classes of this 
specific class are created, this could be a problem). So the fix to this 
class is correct and the warning was about that (and disappeared after 
the fix).

In other words, everything you said above applies, but you are at the 
incorrect level of abstraction in the class hierarchy. :)

That said, there is a bug in GCC 2.95 it seems. It is perfectly valid to 
have a class with virtual methods and non-virtual destructor as long as 
the non-virtual destructor is protected (to avoid, for example, that the 
user delete an object through a pointer to its base class). This will 
result (incorrectly) in the same warning by GCC2. GCC4 has no such problem.
