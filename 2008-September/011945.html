Yes it's entirely untested.
Plus we need to agree on the SPDIF data format, as I think not everyone 
use the same.

&gt;<i> The MediaPlayer would need to check if there is an output on the 
</I>&gt;<i> audio node 
</I>&gt;<i> which matches the encoding of the given stream. Then it would need to 
</I>&gt;<i> bypass the system mixer and connect the audio directly with that 
</I>&gt;<i> encoded

</I>&gt;<i> support 
</I>&gt;<i> this at all after the rewrite to use Media Nodes directly.
</I>
Would also be nice to be able to use mpeg4 hw accelerators as nodes, 
but well...

&gt;<i> It's certainly a feature not only you want to have, but there are 
</I>&gt;<i> more 
</I>&gt;<i> immediate things to do, like supporting h.264 and many other codecs 
</I>&gt;<i> at all. 
</I>&gt;<i> The AVI extractor still has problems and we don't even support mpg 
</I>&gt;<i> and mpg2 
</I>&gt;<i> video. Since we are so few developers, I am wondering if we shouldn't 
</I>&gt;<i> implement more stuff with an ffmpeg backend, like AVI and other 
</I>&gt;<i> extractors. 
</I>&gt;<i> I think the code of Marcus' libopendml is much nicer, but it doesn't 
</I>&gt;<i> help 
</I>&gt;<i> if nobody has time to keep working on it. Obviously, writing more 
</I>&gt;<i> bridges 
</I>&gt;<i> to ffmpeg in the first place is also much work. Puh.
</I>
libavformat also isn't usable directly, as its seeking semantics is too 
different (we seek each track independantly, it seeks the whole stream 
at once).
I wrote a lavf demuxer for BeOS but never released it due to this (it 
worked very well except for seeking...)

I can hand out the code if you want to look at it.

I tried openning the stream twice on lavf to have it seek differently 
but it didn't work well or was too cpu intensive IIRC.
