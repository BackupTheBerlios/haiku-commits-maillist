<PRE>Hi Karsten,

&gt;<i> &gt; 2) a default format (like PNG) should be preselected

</I>
Sounds good, I just like to always have good defaults; if it's &quot;home&quot; 
and &quot;PNG&quot;, I guess most people will never need to touch it.

&gt;<i> &gt; 3) I don't really like the pretty unusual (interface-wise) 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;Options&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; page. Since the &quot;screenshot delay&quot; doesn't seem very useful to me 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (why 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not just press the key later?), one possible option would be a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; single 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; options menu containing all items.
</I>&gt;<i> I'm still a bit unhappy with how it's right now, so I'm always up 
</I>&gt;<i> for better ideas.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But menus are a no go for me. I don't like the way this works to 
</I>&gt;<i> set something, see e.g Deskbars options. To simply turn on 
</I>&gt;<i> seconds, euro date, expando or whatever one has to perform a 
</I>&gt;<i> bunch of off steps and start over and over again. Popup menus are 
</I>&gt;<i> even worse, e.g ActivityMonitor is kind of frustrating to turn on 
</I>&gt;<i> some options there. Even if these actions are performed only once 
</I>&gt;<i> it could be done better.
</I>
Completely agreed. However, menus would very nice for this stuff if 
they could be made sticky in the sense that they stay open until you're 
done with selecting. Deskbar already has some sort of a settings 
window, so that could be extended, though. But especially in apps like 
ActivityMonitor, it doesn't make any sense to ever show much of an UI 
as part of the standard window, as that simply is not what this app is 
about.

I don't have a good solution for this in general. Maybe a button that 
opens a floating window that contains the options. Not sure if I would 
like this much better, though.

Even if it's pretty unobtrusive, maybe we could change the menus to not 
close when you either hold a certain modifier key (preferably the one 
used for multiple-selection in listviews), or use the seconday or 
tertiary mouse button to select the options (with a sticky menu only, 
even though it could work with a non-sticky one as well). I think that 
would be at least an acceptable solution, and with the multiple-
selection modifier, it's nothing completely new either.
If no one has a better idea, I will look into implementing this.

&gt;<i> I think all people involved in Haiku are great developers but 
</I>&gt;<i> that does not instantly mean we know how to properly design a 
</I>&gt;<i> usable application (UI wise). These are jobs for UI designers, 
</I>&gt;<i> which seems we kind a lack off.
</I>
However, I think everyone can spot easily which application suck UI-
wise, and which ones are very usable. At least your examples of Deskbar 
settings and ActivityMonitor are pretty clear ones :-)
The problem is just that good UIs take time to develop as long as the 
application's job is not super simple.

&gt;<i> &gt; 4) I don't like the separator bar too much, generally; I would only 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; add 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it when the window contents are confusing else, ie. to separate 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; functionality that doesn't fit together well (and then, a named box 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; alsmost always the better option IMO).
</I>&gt;<i> I think I'm going to re-group that a bit, getting rid of the bold 
</I>&gt;<i> Options thing at least.
</I>
Okay, I'm anxious to see how it works out in the end :-)

Bye,
   Axel.
