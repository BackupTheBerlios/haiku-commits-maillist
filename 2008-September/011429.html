</I>Oh, and i forgot to add, please mock me, joke on me! I'm coding for 
Haiku for the pleasure, and i also like this project because of the  
great people you find here. If we put too much pressure on us we'll 
never get anywhere, i don't know  for you other devs,  but i think i 
tend to under-commit  because i'm to affraid of breaking what is, after 
all, a pre alpha code base. Of course i always test and proofread a lot 
(really a lot) for each of my (even minor) commit, but think i should 
really relax. Alpha will be out when it's done, let's just breathe.

As a not really related note, another thing that tends to block me is 
the alpha fever that took the dev ml. It's like working in a 50m2 office 
with 200 people wandering around, i mean it is the main channel of 
communication for devs as a group, it is a working place, and a simple 
programming question can get hijacked quickly.
As we approach alpha and there is still a ton of work to do, the list 
gets noisier and noisier.  What we need for a good alpha is on the 
contrary a few months of calm, just like in a tennis match, the public 
gets silent when the players need focusing. A call to calm and reason 
and a reminder of the ml rules would do the job, but i'm no authority in 
there, i don't think it's my role. Maybe a joint declaration from the 
haiku team at large... dunno

Now that was really off topic for a commit ml! Ban me ;-P

Regards,
Alex
