+The Artistic License
+
+Preamble
+
+The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a Package may
+be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some semblance of artistic
+control over the development of the package, while giving the users of the
+package the right to use and distribute the Package in a more-or-less customary
+fashion, plus the right to make reasonable modifications.
+
+Definitions:
+
+  * &quot;Package&quot; refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright
+    Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files created through textual
+    modification.
+  * &quot;Standard Version&quot; refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or
+    has been modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder.
+  * &quot;Copyright Holder&quot; is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for
+    the package.
+  * &quot;You&quot; is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing this Package.
+  * &quot;Reasonable copying fee&quot; is whatever you can justify on the basis of media
+    cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and so on. (You will not
+    be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the computing
+    community at large as a market that must bear the fee.)
+  * &quot;Freely Available&quot; means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though
+    there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means that
+    recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they
+    received it.
+
+1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the Standard
+Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you duplicate all of
+the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.
+
+2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived
+from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in such
+a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.
+
+3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that
+you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when you
+changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following:
+
+  a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them Freely
+     Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an equivalent
+     medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive site such as
+     ftp.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include your
+     modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.
+
+  b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.
+
+  c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict with
+     standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide a separate
+     manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly documents how it
+     differs from the Standard Version.
+
+  d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.
+
+4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or executable
+form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:
+
+    a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files,
+       together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where to
+       get the Standard Version.
+
+    b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the
+       Package with your modifications.
+
+    c) accompany any non-standard executables with their corresponding Standard
+       Version executables, giving the non-standard executables non-standard
+       names, and clearly documenting the differences in manual pages (or
+       equivalent), together with instructions on where to get the Standard
+       Version.
+
+    d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.
+
+5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this Package.
+You may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package. You may not
+charge a fee for this Package itself. However, you may distribute this Package
+in aggregate with other (possibly commercial) programs as part of a larger
+(possibly commercial) software distribution provided that you do not advertise
+this Package as a product of your own.
+
+6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as output from
+the programs of this Package do not automatically fall under the copyright of
+this Package, but belong to whomever generated them, and may be sold
+commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package.
+
+7. C or perl subroutines supplied by you and linked into this Package shall not
+be considered part of this Package.
+
+8. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote
+products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.
+
+9. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot; AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
+WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
+MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
+
+The End

+Artistic License 2.0
+
+Copyright (c) 2000-2006, The Perl Foundation.
+
+Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
+document, but changing it is not allowed.
+
+Preamble
+
+This license establishes the terms under which a given free software Package may
+be copied, modified, distributed, and/or redistributed. The intent is that the
+Copyright Holder maintains some artistic control over the development of that
+Package while still keeping the Package available as open source and free
+software.
+
+You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this license
+directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package. If the terms of this
+license do not permit the full use that you propose to make of the Package, you
+should contact the Copyright Holder and seek a different licensing arrangement.
+
+Definitions
+
+&quot;Copyright Holder&quot; means the individual(s) or organization(s) named in the
+copyright notice for the entire Package.
+
+&quot;Contributor&quot; means any party that has contributed code or other material to the
+Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's procedures.
+
+&quot;You&quot; and &quot;your&quot; means any person who would like to copy, distribute, or modify
+the Package.
+
+&quot;Package&quot; means the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and
+derivatives of that collection and/or of those files. A given Package may
+consist of either the Standard Version, or a Modified Version.
+
+&quot;Distribute&quot; means providing a copy of the Package or making it accessible to
+anyone else, or in the case of a company or organization, to others outside of
+your company or organization.
+
+&quot;Distributor Fee&quot; means any fee that you charge for Distributing this Package or
+providing support for this Package to another party. It does not mean licensing
+fees.
+
+&quot;Standard Version&quot; refers to the Package if it has not been modified, or has
+been modified only in ways explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder.
+
+&quot;Modified Version&quot; means the Package, if it has been changed, and such changes
+were not explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder.
+
+&quot;Original License&quot; means this Artistic License as Distributed with the Standard
+Version of the Package, in its current version or as it may be modified by The
+Perl Foundation in the future.
+
+&quot;Source&quot; form means the source code, documentation source, and configuration
+files for the Package.
+
+&quot;Compiled&quot; form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary, or any other
+form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation of the Source form.
+
+Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution
+
+(1) You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use Modified
+Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that you do not
+Distribute the Modified Version.
+
+Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version
+
+(2) You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the Standard
+Version of this Package in any medium without restriction, either gratis or for
+a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate all of the original copyright
+notices and associated disclaimers. At your discretion, such verbatim copies may
+or may not include a Compiled form of the Package.
+
+(3) You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other modifications
+made available from the Copyright Holder. The resulting Package will still be
+considered the Standard Version, and as such will be subject to the Original
+License.
+
+Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source
+
+(4) You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis or for a
+Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the Modified Version)
+provided that you clearly document how it differs from the Standard Version,
+including, but not limited to, documenting any non-standard features,
+executables, or modules, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following:
+
+(a) make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder of the Standard
+    Version, under the Original License, so that the Copyright Holder may
+    include your modifications in the Standard Version.
+(b) ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not prevent the user
+    installing or running the Standard Version. In addition, the Modified
+    Version must bear a name that is different from the name of the Standard
+    Version.
+(c) allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to make the Source
+    form of the Modified Version available to others under
+    (i) the Original License or
+    (ii) a license that permits the licensee to freely copy, modify and
+         redistribute the Modified Version using the same licensing terms that
+         apply to the copy that the licensee received, and requires that the
+         Source form of the Modified Version, and of any works derived from it,
+         be made freely available in that license fees are prohibited but
+         Distributor Fees are allowed.
+
+Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version or Modified Versions
+without the Source
+
+(5) You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without the
+Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to get the Source
+of the Standard Version. Such instructions must be valid at the time of your
+distribution. If these instructions, at any time while you are carrying out such
+distribution, become invalid, you must provide new instructions on demand or
+cease further distribution. If you provide valid instructions or cease
+distribution within thirty days after you become aware that the instructions are
+invalid, then you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.
+
+(6) You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without the Source,
+provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to the Source of the
+Modified Version.
+
+Aggregating or Linking the Package
+
+(7) You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or Modified
+Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting aggregation provided
+that you do not charge a licensing fee for the Package. Distributor Fees are
+permitted, and licensing fees for other components in the aggregation are
+permitted. The terms of this license apply to the use and Distribution of the
+Standard or Modified Versions as included in the aggregation.
+
+(8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with other works,
+to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to build stand-alone
+binary or bytecode versions of applications that include the Package, and
+Distribute the result without restriction, provided the result does not expose a
+direct interface to the Package.
+
+Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version
+
+(9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that merely
+extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause the Package to
+be a Modified Version. In addition, such works are not considered parts of the
+Package itself, and are not subject to the terms of this license.
+
+General Provisions
+
+(10) Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or Modified
+Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using, modifying or
+distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not use, modify, or
+distribute the Package, if you do not accept this license.
+
+(11) If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified Version made by
+someone other than you, you are nevertheless required to ensure that your
+Modified Version complies with the requirements of this license.
+
+(12) This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark, service
+mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.
+
+(13) This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide, free-of-charge patent
+license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import and otherwise
+transfer the Package with respect to any patent claims licensable by the
+Copyright Holder that are necessarily infringed by the Package. If you institute
+patent litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party
+alleging that the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent
+infringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the date that
+such litigation is filed.
+
+(14) Disclaimer of Warranty: THE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER AND
+CONTRIBUTORS &quot;AS IS' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES. THE IMPLIED
+WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR
+NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY YOUR LOCAL LAW.
+UNLESS REQUIRED BY LAW, NO COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR CONTRIBUTOR WILL BE LIABLE FOR
+ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING IN ANY WAY
+OUT OF THE USE OF THE PACKAGE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
+DAMAGE.
