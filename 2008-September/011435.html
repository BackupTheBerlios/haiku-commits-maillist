</I>Yep true, but we really shouldn't emphasize too much on the commit count 
though, we are not racing for the max number of commits, it is an 
interesting info but we all know it has nothing to do with quality or 
difficulty of the work done, that's why i liked the way it was 
randomised a bit, we're not in competition after all. We could put 
special kudo icons to make some people stand out, but that would be 
based on the recognition and &quot;love&quot;, not on keystrokes. That would bring 
a little more humanity.

Honestly, having my name here is cool and i was really pleased when it 
popped in, but i know that people that care already know what i've done 
and that's what is important to me in the end. A random user will 
probably not care at all anyway. 
Maybe we could just have two or three levels like &quot;old active devs&quot; and 
&quot;recent active devs&quot; and just randomize a bit in each level.

If we want to rethink a little bit more the list, there are tons of ways 
to represent it and here is my humble proposition.
I think that the important info is to represent the current active team. 
When you're an outsider, you like to know who is in the office at the 
moment. I think if there's a meaningfull line to be drawn, it is between 
the occasional contributors and the current active team, off course a 
special mention to people that were in the team at some point could be 
put in an  (pretty honorific imo) &quot;historical section&quot; as they deserve a 
particular recognition but are more a part of the foundation and history 
of the project.
  
Something along those lines:

Haiku Team (currently active team).
       |- active senior dev, rookie dev, webmasters, testers, doc, PR, 
forum support, you name it.

Haiku founding fathers (old devs, admin team etc).
    special thanks, honorific mentions etc...

Haiku occasional contributions (low activity).
  
   
Don't know if it makes sense, anyway thanks stippi for working on it, 
your version is pretty good.

Best regards,
Alex

ps: took me an hour to write, sorry if i ever ignored some previous replies
