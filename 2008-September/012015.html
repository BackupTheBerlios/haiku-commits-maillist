</I>&gt;<i> Completely agreed. However, menus would very nice for this stuff if

</I>&gt;<i> ActivityMonitor, it doesn't make any sense to ever show much of an UI

</I>&gt;<i> about.
</I>
Yes, i totally agree that there's no need to show it all the 
time. No Question.  :)

&gt;<i> I don't have a good solution for this in general. Maybe a button that

</I>&gt;<i> like this much better, though.
</I>
This sound at least worth a try. Since these options are updated 
live, it won't suck less then opening ten times the popup. And 
it's fairly trivial to implement using the layout system, many 
thanks Ingo. We should enforce everyone to use it for Haiku  :)

&gt;<i> Even if it's pretty unobtrusive, maybe we could change the menus to not 
</I>&gt;<i> close when you either hold a certain modifier key (preferably the one 
</I>&gt;<i> used for multiple-selection in listviews), or use the seconday or 
</I>&gt;<i> tertiary mouse button to select the options (with a sticky menu only, 
</I>&gt;<i> even though it could work with a non-sticky one as well). I think that 
</I>&gt;<i> would be at least an acceptable solution, and with the multiple-
</I>&gt;<i> selection modifier, it's nothing completely new either.
</I>&gt;<i> If no one has a better idea, I will look into implementing this.
</I>
This would be nice to have , but we might be the only OS 
implementing it. How to tell a user that comes from an other OS, 
struggling with switched ALT&lt;-&gt;CTRL and then need to know what 
modifiers to press to keep the menu long enough open to do 
multiple settings. Not sure this will work out?

&gt;&gt;<i> I think all people involved in Haiku are great developers but 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that does not instantly mean we know how to properly design a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> usable application (UI wise). These are jobs for UI designers, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which seems we kind a lack off.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> However, I think everyone can spot easily which application suck UI-
</I>&gt;<i> wise, and which ones are very usable. At least your examples of Deskbar 
</I>&gt;<i> settings and ActivityMonitor are pretty clear ones :-)
</I>&gt;<i> The problem is just that good UIs take time to develop as long as the 
</I>&gt;<i> application's job is not super simple.
</I>
Yes i know - implementing isn't that hard, designing it the right 
way(tm) will be the bigger hassle here. Hopefully we will not 
only attract developers with the alpha and get some UI design 
skilled persons on board as well. :)

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Okay, I'm anxious to see how it works out in the end :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Ha-ha-ha, me too  :)


Best regards,
Karsten
