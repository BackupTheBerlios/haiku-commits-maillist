See below.

&gt;<i> &gt; The funny thing is that Haiku has global subpixel based anti-aliasing 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; regardless of the freetype code being compiled in or not. Albeit with 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; our 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; own &quot;filtering&quot;. What gets left out in freetype is the rendering of 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; glyphs 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; three times as wide - only that much. I can't really believe that this 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; portion of the subpixel text rendering is actually patentable...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Are you sure only that part is actually patented?
</I>
No, I am not sure if that part alone is patentable.

&gt;<i> &gt; If we wanted to be cautious, we could completely disable even the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; compilation of our own subpixel stuff according to the freetype option, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; so 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that it is enabled in one single place.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So you currently can enable the feature, but font rendering doesn't 
</I>&gt;<i> change? In that case, I would just mention &quot;subpixel font rendering 
</I>&gt;<i> disabled due to patent issues&quot;, but leave out the rest.
</I>
Sorry for having been unclear:

* If &quot;Glyph hinting&quot; is &quot;off&quot;, then the vector rendering pipelines in AGG 
are used in our app_server. For these, subpixel rendering is available 
independend of freetype compile options. (Both font rendering and other 
vector rendering sports subpixel AA.)

* Hinting is available in unpatented and patented mode. I believe we are 
currently using the patented TrueType byte code hinting. We may try to turn 
that off again, since IIRC the freetype &quot;autohinter&quot;, which is then used 
instead, has seen substantial improvements.

* If hinting is turned on, then app_server uses bitmap caches and these 
bitmaps are rendered by freetype. If the compile time option for subpixel 
rendering in freetype is not enabled, then freetype will return bitmaps 
which are three times as wide, as requested, but each color triplet has 
equal values for R, G and B.

-&gt; Only the combination &quot;hinting on + subpixel rendering&quot; does not yield 
any effect. *None* of the controls is useless though, since even the 
subpixel controls affect other vector rendering, only font rendering looks 
the same as in grayscale mode.

I hope you can see now why idefix was not happy with my initial &quot;fix&quot;.


&gt;<i> &gt; Even then, the hinting on versus off issue remains. Some people like 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; blurry 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; font rendering which is more truthful to the original shapes in the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; font 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; file.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If the hinting is independent from this, all the better.
</I>
Kind of. A separate patent issue which we are currently violating. I 
vaguely remember having read somewhere that Apple is not suing anyone for 
this. Don't know if they have explicitely said so... maybe something to 
research for someone who wants to help the project other than by coding. ;-)

Best regards,
-Stephan
