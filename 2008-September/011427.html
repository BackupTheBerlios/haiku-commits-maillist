</I>No no, don't worry! really :) I only considered the constructive part. I 
admit the ugly part affected me a bit, but i thought it didn't appear in 
my reply :) but hey, maybe it really is (ugly), i mean that's how it 
works with open source, your code is always ephemeral and will be 
rewritten someday by someone that has a better solution. And if i didn't 
like to write code i wouldn't be there anyway.

In general and for further exchanges, you really don't need to handle me 
with kid gloves (just found that expr in the dictionnary). I'm really 
totally open to  any advice given, even if it means i have to rewrite 
everything, you don't even need to put tons of smileys :),  i won't take 
any offense, you'll just have to defend your case a bit off course!
And to further clarify, when i say &quot;please do it&quot;, it is only because i 
honestly believe it would be more efficient time wise (for both of us) 
because you seemed to have the solution already in mind.

Best regards,
Alex
