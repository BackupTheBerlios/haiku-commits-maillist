</I>&gt;<i> Nice little app!
</I>
Thanks!

&gt;<i> However, I also have some remarks (I know it's a work in progress):
</I>&gt;<i> 1) it's always a good idea to add new apps to the build, even if you 
</I>&gt;<i> don't plan to add it to the image yet.
</I>
I didn't because i was unsure how to do it properly without 
breaking plain BeOS targeted builds (if theres anything to do at 
all). Thought about writing a mail but it was to late at night 
and I'm tiered. So going to bed was more promising.  :)

&gt;<i> 2) a default format (like PNG) should be preselected
</I>There will be some kind of small settings, like the last five 
locations saved to and the last saved outputformat + presetting 
the first time started. As you wrote, it's work in progress.

&gt;<i> 3) I don't really like the pretty unusual (interface-wise) &quot;Options&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> page. Since the &quot;screenshot delay&quot; doesn't seem very useful to me (why 
</I>&gt;<i> not just press the key later?), one possible option would be a single 
</I>&gt;<i> options menu containing all items.
</I>I'm still a bit unhappy with how it's right now, so I'm always up 
for better ideas.

But menus are a no go for me. I don't like the way this works to 
set something, see e.g Deskbars options. To simply turn on 
seconds, euro date, expando or whatever one has to perform a 
bunch of off steps and start over and over again. Popup menus are 
even worse, e.g ActivityMonitor is kind of frustrating to turn on 
some options there. Even if these actions are performed only once 
it could be done better.

I think all people involved in Haiku are great developers but 
that does not instantly mean we know how to properly design a 
usable application (UI wise). These are jobs for UI designers, 
which seems we kind a lack off.

&gt;<i> 4) I don't like the separator bar too much, generally; I would only add 
</I>&gt;<i> it when the window contents are confusing else, ie. to separate 
</I>&gt;<i> functionality that doesn't fit together well (and then, a named box is 
</I>&gt;<i> alsmost always the better option IMO).
</I>
I think I'm going to re-group that a bit, getting rid of the bold 
Options thing at least.


Thanks for your comments,
Karsten
