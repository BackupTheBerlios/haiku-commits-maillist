I eventually settled on time() since it seems to actually go all the  
way to kernel space.

They do do something sort of clever that I was thinking about using  
for haiku when/if I get around to rewriting the syscall mechanism. In  
their system they appear to have the gs register pointing to a common  
segment that the kernel keeps mapped permanently into every address  
space. In the segment is apparently the actual syscall code. Thus  
every syscall actually looks like
call *%gs:0x10

Presumably at 0x10 into the segment is a pointer to the syscall  
mechanism optimal for that particular cpu that the kernel set up.

I know other systems have done something like this. You can put all  
sorts of good stuff in there, like the current system tick count and  
the conversion factors needed to convert it back to real time (so  
something like time wouldn't need to enter kernel space). System  
stats, cpu info, whatever. You could even have optimized version of  
memcpy/memset/etc for every cpu there, and have libc just bounce into  
it. I was trying to figure out a good way to select the proper  
syscall/sysenter/int mechanism but without doing gnarly runtime  
patches to keep multiple versions of the library around, it seems to  
be the best strategy.

To find it you can either have it at a fixed offset (0xffff0000) or  
have a segment register point to it (%gs probably, since fs is in  
use). Do you think this would be worth doing? We'd have to burn gs,  
but I don't think we're using it for anything else, and if that's not  
okay, we can just stick it at a known offset. My main concern is  
making sure we dont break beos compatibility, and making sure it  
doesn't make it harder to do stuff like run wine or whatnot. I can't  
think of any good reason why it would, but I'm not terribly familiar  
with that stuff.
