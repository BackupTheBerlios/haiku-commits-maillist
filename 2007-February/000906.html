</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; Log:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; * Reformatted to honor 80 chars/line limit.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; But you know it's a soft limit between 80 and 90 characters? Thanks
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; anyway :-)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Never heard of it. :-)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Seriously, I would appreciate if the 80 columns limit would be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; generally
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; honored. This is a C/C++ project and people work on different
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; platforms
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with different terminals and editors, and 80 columns simply works in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; environments by default. Which is why lots of open source projects
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; use this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; limit, too.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think 80-90 character per line are just fine. At least I don't know
</I>&gt;<i> anyone who is really stuck with 80 fixed characters these days.
</I>
Virtually every terminal on every platform is 80 columns by default (I 
don't know any exception at least).

&gt;<i> If the
</I>&gt;<i> line is like 84 characters wide, it usually looks better in one piece.
</I>
No, it doesn't. In editors set to 80 columns you have to scroll to see the 
excess chars. And terminals soft wrap those lines, which makes files with 
lots of too long line look terrible.

&gt;<i> Our coding style covers it like this which I find very reasonable:
</I>&gt;<i> - Try to wrap your code to a reasonable width of 80 - 90 columns.
</I>
Which I find really absurd. Most open source projects use an 80 columns 
limit (I actually don't know a single exception) and it's a natural limit 
(terminals), even under BeOS. Besides, it's also a typographical fact that 
the readability of text decreases beyond a certain line length (IIRC it's 
even &lt; 70 chars; which is why newspapers use columns, BTW). This might not 
hold for source code to the same extend, but it definitely applies to 
comment passages.

Oh, and regarding the coding style: fs_interface.h had lines with 120+ 
chars.

[...]
&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; Er, and do we need write_link() at all?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; It's not that we would really *need* it, but I thought it was a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; good
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; idea instead of needing to delete and recreate the link whenever
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; want to change its target.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; For example, Tracker does this now whenever you drop a file on the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; info
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; window of a symlink.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I wouldn't consider this a very common usage pattern though (dunno
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; what
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you're doing on your system, though ;-)), at least not common enough
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; worth optimizing, IMHO. Besides AFAIK there isn't even a userland API
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that yet. There are probably cases more worth optimizing, like
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; recursive
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; directory deletion/emptying, but I think we should keep the FS
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; interface
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; slim and only add stuff that is very promising with respect to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; performance
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; or simplicity (like get_vnode_name() for instance).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I thought it would be neat to have, but you're probably right :-)
</I>
Since it doesn't seem to be implemented anywhere, anyway, I'll just remove 
it again.

&gt;<i> Another thing I wanted to have (possibly after R1) are self-healing
</I>&gt;<i> symlinks; for that, the userland API would need to be extended anyway.
</I>
Yep, that'd be a nice feature.

CU, Ingo
