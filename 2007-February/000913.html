</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I think 80-90 character per line are just fine. At least I don't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; know
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; anyone who is really stuck with 80 fixed characters these days.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Virtually every terminal on every platform is 80 columns by default
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; don't know any exception at least).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And how many people are using the terminal for coding *and* have it set
</I>&gt;<i> to 80 columns?
</I>
I rarely use the terminal for editing text, if you mean that by coding, but 
I do use it relatively often to find, grep, and &quot;less&quot; a file. Especially 
under Linux.

&gt;<i> For me, the hard 80 character restriction is a relict of
</I>&gt;<i> the past. I had more possible visible characters on the screen in 1990.
</I>
It's not that I couldn't display more column -- I just checked: a 
full-screen Pe can display 198 chars here -- it's particularly *because* I 
can display so much more on my screen that I don't want my editor windows 
to be wider than necessary, since I rather use the space for more windows. 
Especially under BeOS.

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; If the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; line is like 84 characters wide, it usually looks better in one
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; piece.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; No, it doesn't. In editors set to 80 columns you have to scroll to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; see the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; excess chars. And terminals soft wrap those lines, which makes files
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; lots of too long line look terrible.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Agreed, but then, no one forces you to set your editor to 80 columns :-
</I>&gt;<i> )
</I>
The vast majority of lines is shorter than 80 chars anyway. Why have the 
editor window always waste more space for the maybe 5% of lines that 
someone feels look better not being wrapped?

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Our coding style covers it like this which I find very reasonable:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; - Try to wrap your code to a reasonable width of 80 - 90 columns.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Which I find really absurd. Most open source projects use an 80
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; columns
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; limit (I actually don't know a single exception) and it's a natural
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; limit
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, OpenTracker and Haiku would be two already :-)
</I>
Scary. ;-)

&gt;<i> &gt; (terminals), even under BeOS. Besides, it's also a typographical fact
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the readability of text decreases beyond a certain line length (IIRC
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; even &lt; 70 chars; which is why newspapers use columns, BTW). This
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; might not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hold for source code to the same extend, but it definitely applies to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; comment passages.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It does, and that's why I find 80-90 columns to be a good guideline.
</I>&gt;<i> Then I can have my editor set to about 90 columns and always have
</I>&gt;<i> everything on the screen without scrolling ;-)
</I>&gt;<i> Don't worry, I usually try to use less than 80 columns per line, but
</I>&gt;<i> there are some exceptions where I let the look decide and keep slightly
</I>&gt;<i> longer lines as a whole.
</I>
I see, you're dead loss. :-)

&gt;<i> &gt; Oh, and regarding the coding style: fs_interface.h had lines with 120
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; +
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; chars.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It definitely needed cleanup, I agree; I just wanted to mention that
</I>&gt;<i> it's a soft 80 column limit, not a hard one.
</I>
For some reason a &quot;soft limit&quot; leaves the same bad aftertaste as standards 
being approximately followed.

&gt;<i> &gt; [...]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Another thing I wanted to have (possibly after R1) are self-healing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; symlinks; for that, the userland API would need to be extended
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; anyway.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yep, that'd be a nice feature.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The only problem is that only some file systems could deliver it.
</I>
It's the same for attributes and queries.

CU, Ingo
