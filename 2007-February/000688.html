That's right, but I definitely never agreed on making it the default 
(without the above patch).
Thanks for having fixed this now, anyway.

</I>
Not really; OpenTracker had a very limited pool of developers with 
write access, and I wouldn't mind keeping it that way (I wouldn't mind 
if that is only an imaginary border, though, as long as it's followed).
The recent burst of changes (started with the vector icon stuff) at 
least made it clear that it's very impractical to keep both 
repositories around; however, I didn't even import the SF repository 
into ours yet.
OpenTracker is still a project independent from Haiku - its main target 
audience is BeOS until Haiku releases something worthwhile. And at 
least until then, I consider myself being its maintainer.
Most of the recent changes needed at least a second commit that fixed 
problems introduced with the first one. If someone knowledgeable of 
Tracker internals would have had a look before, this wouldn't have 
happened.
I try to keep OT as stable as possible at all times, bigger changes 
would need to go into a branch. If that's not possible in the Haiku 
repository, it's not ready to host OpenTracker.

Bye,
   Axel.
