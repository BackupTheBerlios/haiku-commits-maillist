</I>
And how many people are using the terminal for coding *and* have it set 
to 80 columns? For me, the hard 80 character restriction is a relict of 
the past. I had more possible visible characters on the screen in 1990.

&gt;<i> &gt; If the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; line is like 84 characters wide, it usually looks better in one 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; piece.
</I>&gt;<i> No, it doesn't. In editors set to 80 columns you have to scroll to 
</I>&gt;<i> see the 
</I>&gt;<i> excess chars. And terminals soft wrap those lines, which makes files 
</I>&gt;<i> with 
</I>&gt;<i> lots of too long line look terrible.
</I>
Agreed, but then, no one forces you to set your editor to 80 columns :-
)

&gt;<i> &gt; Our coding style covers it like this which I find very reasonable:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - Try to wrap your code to a reasonable width of 80 - 90 columns.
</I>&gt;<i> Which I find really absurd. Most open source projects use an 80 
</I>&gt;<i> columns 
</I>&gt;<i> limit (I actually don't know a single exception) and it's a natural 
</I>&gt;<i> limit 
</I>
Well, OpenTracker and Haiku would be two already :-)

&gt;<i> (terminals), even under BeOS. Besides, it's also a typographical fact 
</I>&gt;<i> that 
</I>&gt;<i> the readability of text decreases beyond a certain line length (IIRC 
</I>&gt;<i> it's 
</I>&gt;<i> even &lt; 70 chars; which is why newspapers use columns, BTW). This 
</I>&gt;<i> might not 
</I>&gt;<i> hold for source code to the same extend, but it definitely applies to 
</I>&gt;<i> comment passages.
</I>
It does, and that's why I find 80-90 columns to be a good guideline. 
Then I can have my editor set to about 90 columns and always have 
everything on the screen without scrolling ;-)
Don't worry, I usually try to use less than 80 columns per line, but 
there are some exceptions where I let the look decide and keep slightly 
longer lines as a whole.

&gt;<i> Oh, and regarding the coding style: fs_interface.h had lines with 120
</I>&gt;<i> + 
</I>&gt;<i> chars.
</I>
It definitely needed cleanup, I agree; I just wanted to mention that 
it's a soft 80 column limit, not a hard one.

&gt;<i> [...]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Er, and do we need write_link() at all?
</I>[...]
&gt;<i> &gt; I thought it would be neat to have, but you're probably right :-)
</I>&gt;<i> Since it doesn't seem to be implemented anywhere, anyway, I'll just 
</I>&gt;<i> remove 
</I>&gt;<i> it again.
</I>
Okay, why not.

&gt;<i> &gt; Another thing I wanted to have (possibly after R1) are self-healing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; symlinks; for that, the userland API would need to be extended 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; anyway.
</I>&gt;<i> Yep, that'd be a nice feature.
</I>
The only problem is that only some file systems could deliver it.

Bye,
   Axel.
