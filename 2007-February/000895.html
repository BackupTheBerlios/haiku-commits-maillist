</I>
Never heard of it. :-)
Seriously, I would appreciate if the 80 columns limit would be generally 
honored. This is a C/C++ project and people work on different platforms 
with different terminals and editors, and 80 columns simply works in all 
environments by default. Which is why lots of open source projects use this 
limit, too.

&gt;<i> &gt; * Renamed a few parameters of the FS module hooks:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   - *file in the attribute functions to *vnode
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   - v to vnode
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   - I could barely restrain myself from renaming the &quot;_*&quot; parameters.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     understand this marks return parameters, but I'd prefer a nicer
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; prefix
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     or suffix (that doesn't makes you think this is a private/
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; internal
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     identifier) like &quot;out&quot;, &quot;ret&quot;, &quot;return&quot;, &quot;result&quot;, or something
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; similar.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's just what you're used to - I like the underscore prefix for that.
</I>&gt;<i> In the fs_cache.h header, though, they seem to be mistakenly there
</I>&gt;<i> (probably because I use that for temporary-to-be-casted parameters as
</I>&gt;<i> well - no one is perfect ;-)).
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, I guess I could live with &quot;out&quot; as well; I just used '_'
</I>&gt;<i> everywhere in the code I wrote - which is a lot, too.
</I>
It'd be nice to have a pseudo-standard here, but I really don't like your 
underscore. :-)

&gt;<i> &gt; I'd also like to propose renaming {read,write}_link() to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; {read,write}_symlink().
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Fine with me, I used Be's naming, but symlink would be more correct.
</I>
OK, will change that soon.

&gt;<i> &gt; Er, and do we need write_link() at all?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's not that we would really *need* it, but I thought it was a good
</I>&gt;<i> idea instead of needing to delete and recreate the link whenever you
</I>&gt;<i> want to change its target.
</I>&gt;<i> For example, Tracker does this now whenever you drop a file on the info
</I>&gt;<i> window of a symlink.
</I>
I wouldn't consider this a very common usage pattern though (dunno what 
you're doing on your system, though ;-)), at least not common enough to be 
worth optimizing, IMHO. Besides AFAIK there isn't even a userland API for 
that yet. There are probably cases more worth optimizing, like recursive 
directory deletion/emptying, but I think we should keep the FS interface 
slim and only add stuff that is very promising with respect to performance 
or simplicity (like get_vnode_name() for instance).

CU, Ingo
