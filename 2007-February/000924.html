+\file Autolock.h
+\brief Implements a handy locking utility.
+*/
+
+/*!
+\class BAutolock
+\ingroup support
+\ingroup libbe
+\brief Convenient utility to make parts of your code thread-safe easily.
+
+The autolocker uses a BLooper or a BLocker in order to protect a part
+of your code. This class is usually used in combination with a BLocker
+that protects a certain part of your code and data that are being
+accessed by multiple threads. While BAutolock does not add any features
+to locking, it provides a mechanism to easily lock and protect a part of your
+code. 
+
+Normally, when you need to protect data, you would have to make sure that
+all your locks are paired with unlocks. Below is a simple example, but you
+can imagine that there are more complex situations where you might spend a
+lot of time debugging a hang because you didn't pair all the Lock()s with an
+Unlock(). See the example:
+
+\code
+status_t
+Receiver::HandleCall(Call *call)
+{
+  ... work on call data ...
+
+  fDataLocker-&gt;Lock()
+
+  ... perform changes ...
+
+  if (!success)
+  {
+    fDataLocker-&gt;Unlock();
+    return B_ERROR;
+  }
+    
+  fDataLocker-&gt;Unlock()
+  return B_OK;
+}
+\endcode
+
+With the BAutolock this example can be rewritten as follows:
+\code
+status_t
+Receiver::HandleCall(Call *call)
+{
+  ... work on call data ...
+  
+  BAutolock autolock(fDataLocker);
+  
+  ... perform changes ...
+  
+  if (!success)
+    return B_ERROR;
+  
+  return B_OK;
+}
+\endcode
+
+Since the object is created on stack, it is destroyed as soon as we leave
+the function. Because the destruction of the object causes it to unlock
+the BLocker or BLooper, you don't have to manually make sure that every
+exit from the function is properly written.

+
+Basically you may assume that when the object is created, you are
+almost always sure the actual locking succeeds. It might fail if the
+BLocker or BLooper are destroyed though. The semaphore will be
+released and the Lock() call will fail. 
+
+If you might get this behaviour, you can use this method to help you
+protect yourself from it.

+\class BBlockCache
+\ingroup support
+\ingroup libbe
+\brief A class that creates and maintains a pool of memory blocks.
+
+In some performance critical code there might come a time where you
+require a lot of little blocks of memory that you want to access and
+dispose of continuously. Since allocating and freeing memory are an
+'expensive' operation, it's better to have a pool of memory blocks at
+your disposal. Luckily, the Haiku API provides a class that will act
+as the administrator of your memory pool, so you won't have to reinvent
+the wheel.
+
+The principle is easy. The constructor takes the number of blocks you
+want to create beforehand, the size of the blocks and the method of
+allocation. This can either be #B_OBJECT_CACHE or #B_MALLOC_CACHE.
+The first uses C++ operators \c new[] and \c delete[], the second uses
+\c malloc() and \c free(). Unless you have specific demands on performance
+or you want to take care of freeing the objects yourself, either use is fine. 
+
+As soon as you have the memory pool, you can Get() blocks. If the
+pre-allocated memory blocks run out, BBlockCache will allocate
+new ones, so you won't have to worry about availability. As soon as
+you're done, you can Save() the memory back into the pool, though
+BBlockCache will make sure that there won't be more blocks saved
+than the initial number you said when you created the object.
+
+As soon as you got a pointer from the Get() method, you own that
+block of memory. This means that you have the liberty to dispose
+of it yourself. It also means that when you delete your BBlockCache
+instance, any blocks of memory that are checked out won't be destroyed.
+In case you might want to delete your objects yourself, make sure you 
+use the proper way. If you created the object as #B_OBJECT_CACHE
+use \c delete[] to free your object. If you created the object
+as #B_MALLOC_CACHE, use \c free(). Please note that it defeats
+the purpose of this class if your are going to free all the objects yourself,
+since it basically means that when the pool runs out, Get() will be allocating
+the objects itself. 
+
+\note BBlockCache is thread-safe.
+*/
+
+/*!
+\fn BBlockCache::BBlockCache(uint32 blockCount, size_t blockSize, uint32 allocationType)
+\brief Allocate a new memory pool. 
+
+\param blockCount The number of free memory blocks you want to initially allocate.
+ This number is also used as a maximum number of free blocks that will be kept.
+\param blockSize The size of the blocks. 
+\param allocationType Either #B_OBJECT_CACHE for using \c new[] and \c delete[]
+  or #B_MALLOC_CACHE for \c malloc() and \c free().
+*/
+
+/*!
+\fn BBlockCache::~BBlockCache()
+\brief Destroy the empty blocks in the free list.
+
+Note that the blocks you checked out with Get() and not checked back in with

+*/
+
+/*!
+\fn void *BBlockCache::Get(size_t blockSize)
+\brief Get a block from the pool of free blocks.
+
+If the pool runs out of free blocks, a new one will be allocated. Please note that
+if the size given in the \c blockSize parameter is different from the size given
+in the constructor, that a new block of memory will be created. Only sizes that
+match the blocks in the memory pool will come from the pool.
+
+\param blockSize The required size of the memory block.
+\return Returns a pointer to a memory block, or \c NULL if locking the object
+failed.
+*/
+
+/*!
+\fn void BBlockCache::Save(void *pointer, size_t blockSize)
+\brief Save a block of memory to the memory pool.
+
+The block of memory will only be added to the pool if the \c blockSize is equal
+to the size the object was created with, and if the maximum number free blocks
+in the list won't be passed. Else the memory will be freeed. 
+
+Note that it is perfectly valid to pass objects other than you got from Get(), but
+please note that the way it was created confirms with the way memory is allocated
+and freed in this pool. Thus, only feed blocks that were created with \c new[] if
+the allocation type is #B_OBJECT_CACHE, likewise use only objects allocated
+with \c malloc() when the allocation type is #B_MALLOC_CACHE.

+\class BList
+\ingroup support
+\ingroup libbe
+\brief An ordered container that is designed to hold generic \c void * objects.
+
+This class is designed to be used for a variety of tasks. Unlike similar
+implementations in other libraries, this class is not based on templates,
+and as such is inherently not typed. So it will be the job of the coder to
+make sure proper data will be entered, since the compiler cannot check this.
+
+BList contains a list of items that will grow and shrink depending on
+how much items are in it. So you will not have to do any of the
+memory management. Furthermore, it's ordered. Those properties make it
+useful in a whole range of situations, for example in the interface kit in 
+the BListView class.
+
+A note on ownership of the objects might come in handy. BList at no time
+assumes ownership of the objects, so removing items from the list will
+only remove those items from the list, it will not delete the item. In the
+same spirit you should also make sure that before you might delete an
+object that's in a list, you will remove it from the list first. 
+
+\warning This class is not thread-safe.
+
+The class implements methods to add and remove items, reorder items,
+retrieve items, querying for items and some advanced methods which let
+you perform a certain tasks to all the items of the list.

+/*!
+\fn BList::BList(int32 count = 20)
+\brief Create a new list with a number of empty slots.
+
+The memory management of this class allocates new memory per block. The
+\c count parameter can be tweaked to determine the size of those blocks.
+In general, if you know your list is only going to contain a fixed maximum
+number of items, pass that value. If you expect your list to have very few items,
+it's probably safe to choose a low number. This is as to prevent the list from
+taking up unneccesary memory. If you expect the list to contain a large
+number of items, choose a higher value, since every time the memory is full, all
+the items have to be copied into a new piece of allocated memory which is
+an expensive operation.
+
+If you are unsure, you don't have to break your head over this. As long as you
+don't use a lot of lists or as long as the list isn't used in one of the
