</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But you know it's a soft limit between 80 and 90 characters? Thanks
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; anyway :-)
</I>&gt;<i> Never heard of it. :-)
</I>&gt;<i> Seriously, I would appreciate if the 80 columns limit would be 
</I>&gt;<i> generally 
</I>&gt;<i> honored. This is a C/C++ project and people work on different 
</I>&gt;<i> platforms 
</I>&gt;<i> with different terminals and editors, and 80 columns simply works in 
</I>&gt;<i> all 
</I>&gt;<i> environments by default. Which is why lots of open source projects 
</I>&gt;<i> use this 
</I>&gt;<i> limit, too.
</I>
I think 80-90 character per line are just fine. At least I don't know 
anyone who is really stuck with 80 fixed characters these days. If the 
line is like 84 characters wide, it usually looks better in one piece.
Our coding style covers it like this which I find very reasonable:
- Try to wrap your code to a reasonable width of 80 - 90 columns.

&gt;<i> &gt; It's just what you're used to - I like the underscore prefix for 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In the fs_cache.h header, though, they seem to be mistakenly there
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (probably because I use that for temporary-to-be-casted parameters 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; well - no one is perfect ;-)).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Anyway, I guess I could live with &quot;out&quot; as well; I just used '_'
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; everywhere in the code I wrote - which is a lot, too.
</I>&gt;<i> It'd be nice to have a pseudo-standard here, but I really don't like 
</I>&gt;<i> your 
</I>&gt;<i> underscore. :-)
</I>
Ah well :-)

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I'd also like to propose renaming {read,write}_link() to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; {read,write}_symlink().
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Fine with me, I used Be's naming, but symlink would be more 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; correct.
</I>&gt;<i> OK, will change that soon.
</I>
Thanks :-)

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Er, and do we need write_link() at all?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It's not that we would really *need* it, but I thought it was a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; good
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; idea instead of needing to delete and recreate the link whenever 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; want to change its target.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; For example, Tracker does this now whenever you drop a file on the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; info
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; window of a symlink.
</I>&gt;<i> I wouldn't consider this a very common usage pattern though (dunno 
</I>&gt;<i> what 
</I>&gt;<i> you're doing on your system, though ;-)), at least not common enough 
</I>&gt;<i> to be 
</I>&gt;<i> worth optimizing, IMHO. Besides AFAIK there isn't even a userland API 
</I>&gt;<i> for 
</I>&gt;<i> that yet. There are probably cases more worth optimizing, like 
</I>&gt;<i> recursive 
</I>&gt;<i> directory deletion/emptying, but I think we should keep the FS 
</I>&gt;<i> interface 
</I>&gt;<i> slim and only add stuff that is very promising with respect to 
</I>&gt;<i> performance 
</I>&gt;<i> or simplicity (like get_vnode_name() for instance).
</I>
I thought it would be neat to have, but you're probably right :-)
Another thing I wanted to have (possibly after R1) are self-healing 
symlinks; for that, the userland API would need to be extended anyway.

Bye,
   Axel.
