I've stated several times in the past that I prefer to get patches to 
OT instead of clobbering the mirrored repository in Haiku directly. 
Obviously, it did not work.
It's my fault, too, as I did not mention it anymore in the recent past 
- because I won't merge Haiku's changes back SF OT again, and I 
probably also wanted to see where it would go.

</I>
I don't mind bug fixes, refactoring, cleanup changes etc. - if you're 
familiar with the code, I don't mind seeing it applied directly (since 
I don't have any extra work with the OT repository anymore now).
But as long as you're not familiar with it, or make eventually 
questionable patches (like usability changes), I would still like to 
get a patch instead. You could also open a branch, do your changes 
there, and ask me to merge it back, whatever you prefer.

Of course, I could also maintain current OT in a branch instead of the 
main Haiku repository - but since I don't see the need for any major 
Tracker changes (besides the eventual rewrite), I would like to save 
this extra work.

Bye,
   Axel.
