</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; OK, so we don't get around updating the tools.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Today I have tried and actually managed to get binutils-2.17 working with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; gcc-2.95.3 (and it wasn't half as bad as I thought it would be ;o). This
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; fixes the build problems Marcus had encountered with the PXE stage1
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; bootloader.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Err, it felt weird writing that and *of course* it wasn't that easy at all.
</I>
I can't say it often enough: My Hero! :-)
Seriously, unthankful and annoying tasks like this mostly go unrewarded, so: 
Big thanks from me!

&gt;<i> It turns out that binutils-2.17 seems to optimize the eh_frame section 
</I>&gt;<i> (stack
</I>&gt;<i> unwinding info required for exception handling) in a way that is 
</I>&gt;<i> incompatible
</I>&gt;<i> with gcc-2.95.3. It took me the last couple of days to fix that (by mixing &amp;
</I>&gt;<i> matching code of 2.15 and 2.17 in a rather crude way).
</I>
I suppose this answer the open question whether we want to unify the binutils 
for the legacy gcc and gcc 4 versions, right?

&gt;<i> However, one more problem remains, which is the fact that using the new
</I>&gt;<i> binutils creates executables which crash the loader of newer BeOS versions
</I>&gt;<i> (BONE, Dano and probably Zeta, too). The older workaround does not apply
</I>&gt;<i> easily and I haven't yet managed to find a way around the problem.
</I>&gt;<i> So beware: do not use these binutils to generate anything that will be
</I>&gt;<i> executed on BONE, Dano or Zeta, or else you will take a trip to KDL!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If I find the time, I'll work on that some more, but honestly, I am really
</I>&gt;<i> fed up with these old tools.
</I>
While it is a pity to no longer have a gcc/binutils combo for all BeOS 
platforms in our repository (at least no trunk version), their main purpose 
was cross-compilation anyway, and the (in a somewhat sad way) still up to 
date and conveniently pre-built gcc package you've published on BeBits is 
still available, too. So, never mind...

&gt;<i> In my opinion, we should switch to gcc-4 soon,
</I>&gt;<i> never mind binary compatibility...
</I>
The more time passes while we're still working on R1 the more annoying 
becomes the gap between the compiler we do use and the one we could use. 
Ironically with your excellent work on gcc 2.95.3 you've probably 
considerably put off the radical decision to screw binary compatibility. 
Actually at the moment I don't see many reasons for changing the compiler -- 
AFAIK everything builds and works as would be expected (even before your 
current binutils update, the not building PXE stage 1 boot loader was only a 
minor inconvenience).

On the other hand I also have no personal motivation on insisting on binary 
compatibility: I don't really use any only in binary form available 
application or driver. Others might, though. We can take this to the admin 
list and start another round of the discussion...

CU, Ingo
