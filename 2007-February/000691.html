<PRE>&gt;<i> That's right, but I definitely never agreed on making it the default 
</I>&gt;<i> (without the above patch).
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for having fixed this now, anyway.
</I>The default value patch would be my doing. I thought it had been agreed 
upon, but apparently I misunderstood. Sorry about that.

&gt;<i> Not really; OpenTracker had a very limited pool of developers with 
</I>&gt;<i> write access, and I wouldn't mind keeping it that way (I wouldn't 
</I>&gt;<i> mind 
</I>&gt;<i> if that is only an imaginary border, though, as long as it's 
</I>&gt;<i> followed).
</I>&gt;<i> The recent burst of changes (started with the vector icon stuff) at 
</I>&gt;<i> least made it clear that it's very impractical to keep both 
</I>&gt;<i> repositories around; however, I didn't even import the SF repository 
</I>&gt;<i> into ours yet.
</I>&gt;<i> OpenTracker is still a project independent from Haiku - its main 
</I>&gt;<i> target 
</I>&gt;<i> audience is BeOS until Haiku releases something worthwhile. And at 
</I>&gt;<i> least until then, I consider myself being its maintainer.
</I>&gt;<i> Most of the recent changes needed at least a second commit that fixed 
</I>&gt;<i> problems introduced with the first one. If someone knowledgeable of 
</I>&gt;<i> Tracker internals would have had a look before, this wouldn't have 
</I>&gt;<i> happened.
</I>&gt;<i> I try to keep OT as stable as possible at all times, bigger changes 
</I>&gt;<i> would need to go into a branch. If that's not possible in the Haiku 
</I>&gt;<i> repository, it's not ready to host OpenTracker.
</I>I would say, yes, it *is* an overreaction to set permissions and lock 
everyone out. I find it offensive that we can't ask someone to not do 
something with the expectation that they will listen. We have never 
operated that way, nor do I think we should start. At the same time, 
the current situation is not working either. I'd say that it simply has 
come from a lack of clear expectations. 

Right now everyone is working on lots of different things all over the 
tree. This is not necessarily a bad thing unless someone just decides 
to go on their own and start making well-intentioned &quot;extra&quot; changes 
which not everyone agrees on or has unintended side effects. I'll be 
the first to admit guilt on this part and also point out that I haven't 
been the only one to do this.

Waldemar and I have agreed to just hit critical usability issues (like 
the Revert button thing) and nail bugs. I'm also working on tying up 
loose ends I've left like ResEdit and the outstanding bug on CDPlayer.

Can we simply just run things past you except in the most minor of 
changes (typo fixes, etc) ?
