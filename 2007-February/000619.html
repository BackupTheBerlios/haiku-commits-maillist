Maybe I haven't thought this through. Now that I do, it seems to be 
indeed impossible that a duplicate page (when two caches are merged) 
can still be mapped by an upper area; the base cache of a copy-on-write 
operation cannot be changed anymore.
That just happened before because of the locking problems.

</I>
I was thinking to allocate an array of them with each area upfront. 
They would need at least 8 byte (singly linked with a pointer to the 
area), or 12 byte (doubly linked) for faster area destruction. We could 
also use it to store the protection bits to implement mprotect() 
correctly (which would then make 16 bytes). That would mean 0.3% of all 
potential memory would be wasted due to those (plus the 40 byte per 
physical page or 0.9% of all physical memory, ie. 10 MB on a 1GB 
machine).

Since it would then be used only for the page scanner, I will give it 
another thought. In any case, it's about time for a decent page scanner 
to appear :-)

Bye,
   Axel.
