Please don't mind my English, I've been hearing and learning Spanish
all day so I might be a bit off :-)

As far as I know, there's no 'official' dicision on it yet, but I'm
still in the process of investigating the 'best' option, for both
documenters (which will bound to be partially done by developers with
time-constraints) and output formats. As I said before, everytime I'm
working on the docbook, I feel I'm doing a lot of the work for
nothing, and since writing documentation is bound to be done by
developers (perhaps in a sense that developers would supply the crude
version which documenters will enhance), I don't want to bother them
with a complicated set of rules on how to write docs, especially with
regard to formal requirements (which docbook imposes a lot more than
Doxygen).

Plus, much of the magic tools we might need for a docbook
implementation comes automatically with doxygen, since it was actually
designed to document code.

There are a few deficiencies to work out with Doxygen, which either
need a solution or we might decide to let the issue linger.

The main issue is how to present all the data into nice kits. If you
take the support kit, which I worked on mostly, you will find a way to
group things. Peculiarities I don't like:
- Doxygen places a lot of importance in files. I don't think files are
so important. I already removed files with only classes, because they
show up in the module anyway. This probably is the way to go.
- In order to remove a header from the module list but keep the
methods, I created a submodule. I think this is the best way to
proceed so I keep it.
- It is possible to have function groups, but the limitation is that
they each require their own documentation, and that they are only
documented on level of the overview, not the detailed descriptions
(see BString). There is a configuration option use one piece of
doucmentation for all members of a group, but this copies rather than
groups the methods in detailed descriptions. Possible
solutions/workarounds: a) live with the current situation or b) write
a patch for doxygen to have more bebook like behaviour. I did
experiment with a way of giving grouped methods an introduction (see
the comparison methods of BString).
- The overview page of a module has some deficiencies. It does present
a good list of the headers and the classes it takes (not so fond of
the headers, but for things like parsedate.h and syslog.h I'll
tolerate them), but the introductory page is placed underneath
everything which I severely dislike. Options, a) either change the
code of doxygen or b) write a index page that isn't actually part of
the module. That's not really a 'biggie', since pages have a weak
relation with modules anyway.

All in all a list which ended up being quite big. I'm willing to have
a discussion on this, but in  the mean time I'm going to try to
convert BList to docbook to see where the 'rub' is.

Niels
