I was using close() last time I tested, since that actually has at

Sounds like a good idea - especially when it's *that* fast! :-)

We already export this sort of stuff in an area mapped into each 
userland team - have a look at real_time_clock.c (the userland 
counterpart lives in libroot.so).
But since it has to be cloned in userland first, it wouldn't be 
possible to use this for syscalls the way it's setup right now.

&gt;<i> stats, cpu info, whatever. You could even have optimized version of

</I>&gt;<i> patches to keep multiple versions of the library around, it seems to

</I>
Yes, I would like that a lot better than what BeOS is using (having 
.patch files along executables).

&gt;<i> To find it you can either have it at a fixed offset (0xffff0000) or  
</I>&gt;<i> have a segment register point to it (%gs probably, since fs is in  
</I>&gt;<i> use). Do you think this would be worth doing? We'd have to burn gs,  
</I>&gt;<i> but I don't think we're using it for anything else, and if that's not  
</I>&gt;<i> okay, we can just stick it at a known offset. My main concern is  
</I>&gt;<i> making sure we dont break beos compatibility, and making sure it

</I>&gt;<i> think of any good reason why it would, but I'm not terribly familiar  
</I>&gt;<i> with that stuff.
</I>
I don't think that using %gs would put us into trouble there. Even 
though I don't know what BeOS is using it for, userland apps surely 
don't use it. I don't know if Wine requires any such hacks to run, but 
I don't think it will as you cannot program the GDT/IDT from userland 
anyway.
And even if we're using it now, we can also change it later if we 
really need to.
IOW since Linux is so much faster with syscalls, I'm all for copying 
their magic.

Bye,
   Axel.
