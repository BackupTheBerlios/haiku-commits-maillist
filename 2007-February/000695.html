<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; Most of the recent changes needed at least a second commit that 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; fixed 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; problems introduced with the first one. If someone knowledgeable of 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Tracker internals would have had a look before, this wouldn't have 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; happened.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I try to keep OT as stable as possible at all times, bigger changes 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would need to go into a branch. If that's not possible in the Haiku 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; repository, it's not ready to host OpenTracker.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Right now everyone is working on lots of different things all over 
</I>&gt;<i> the 
</I>&gt;<i> tree. This is not necessarily a bad thing unless someone just decides 
</I>&gt;<i> to go on their own and start making well-intentioned &quot;extra&quot; changes 
</I>&gt;<i> which not everyone agrees on or has unintended side effects. I'll be 
</I>&gt;<i> the first to admit guilt on this part and also point out that I 
</I>&gt;<i> haven't 
</I>&gt;<i> been the only one to do this.

I know I myself already stepped onto someone's shoe at least once.

May I suggest that we use the same method the ffmpeg team has ?

When someone wants to make a change to some part he doesn't maintain, 
he posts the diff on the mailing list (this commit list ?), and ask for 
approval of the maintainer, who either says &quot;apply&quot; or &quot;rejected, 
because...&quot;.
This way you can also tell something like &quot;good idea but you could do 
cleaner by this and that...&quot;, or &quot;could you care also fixing foo&quot;, 
without having to edit the source yourself, revert or fix, test, 
commit.

I found it a bit frustrating at first, but it seems logical now, and I 
know I wouldn't want someone to tamper with the beos code I have 
there... Besides it seems to work quite well so far (but it's a smaller 
project).

Fran&#231;ois.
