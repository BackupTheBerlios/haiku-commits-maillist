Actually, it may be this bug, because the problem would have shown also in 
the event that the device was closed manually (in 
BInputServerDevice::Stop()). Then the thread should have woken up from it's 
blocking ioctl() and went through the device removal, even though the other 
thread already held the locks and waited for the control thread. That the 
mouse still works could be explained if all this happened to the keyboard 
device first. I can check it though... and the bug is still there... :-) 
Going into KDL, I can probably analyse the problem.

Best regards,
-Stephan
