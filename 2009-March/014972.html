Log:
* Tracked down the mkdepend tool which Ingo used in his updated makefile-engine
  which auto-generates dependencies. It was written by Lars Duening for BeOS
  and uses libglob, which is also part of make. To re-use libglob and since
  make is already part of the Haiku tree, I added mkdepend to the bin tools.
* Added Lars Duening's copyright to AboutSystem.
* Added skeleton makefile and makefile-engine to data/develop.
* Added mkdepend and makefile-engine files to the Development optional package.
  It could be argued to move the make bin command there too, from it's current
  location in the HaikuImage file. However, make could be useful to always
  have available.

+Introduction
+------------
+  Makefiles are very useful in the development of larger program systems,
+  as they notate the various dependencies and associated needed actions
+  in a machine-useable notation. Unfortunately it's the most important
+  dependency between C sources and their includes which have to be
+  maintained by hand, a most boring and errorprone task.
+
+  MkDepend is one of those programs which attempt to automate this part
+  of development by scanning source files for includes and repeating this
+  step recursively until the complete transitive closure of included files
+  is determined. The found dependencies are then written into an existing
+  makefile, keeping it up to date, and/or into a separate file (the 'depfile')
+  for use by the makefile or for documentary purposes.
+
+  The advantage of using MkDepend instead of the built-in dependency
+  facilities of modern compilers is that (a) MkDepend is faster,
+  (b) simplifies the maintenance of multiple and/or portable Makefiles,
+  and (c) you can modify it for your special needs.
+
+
+Usage
+-----
+  MkDepend is a shell-only program, compiled for R4.5
+
+
+  mkdepend  {-i|-I|--include &lt;includepath&gt;[::&lt;symbol&gt;]}
+            {-x|--except  &lt;filepattern&gt;}
+            {-S|--select  &lt;filepattern&gt;}
+            {-s|--suffix  &lt;src_ext&gt;{,&lt;src_ext&gt;}[+][:&lt;obj_ext&gt;] | [+]:&lt;obj_ext&gt;}
+            {-p|--objpat  &lt;src_ext&gt;{,&lt;src_ext&gt;}[+]:&lt;obj_pattern&gt;}
+            [-f|--file    &lt;makefile&gt;]
+            [-d|--dep     &lt;depfile&gt;]
+            [-l|--flat]
+            [-m|--ignore-missing]
+            [-w|--no-warn-exit]
+            [-v|--verbose]
+            [-h|-?|--help|--longhelp]
+            [-V|--version]
+            {&lt;filename&gt;}
+
+
+    All option keywords are case sensitive. The space between the short
+    form of the keywords and their operands may be omitted. For example
+
+      mkdepend -I/include
+      mkdepend -i /include
+      mkdepend -I=/include
+      mkdepend --include=/include
+      mkdepend --include /include
+
+    are all equivalent. Several short options may be combined, but only
+    one of them may take an argument, and it must be the last one. For
+    example:
+
+      mkdepend -vl
+      mkdepend -vf Makefile
+
+    are legal, but
+
+      mkdepend -fv Makefile
+
+    will be misunderstood as 'mkdepend -f=v Makefile'.
+
+    The option '--' is special in that it marks the end of all option
+    recognition. All following arguments are considered filenames even
+    if they start with '-' or '--'.
+
+
+General Operation
+-----------------
+
+  MkDepend is given a 'skeleton' of C source files and searches them for
+  included files. The includes found are recursively searched for includes
+  themselves, until the complete transitive closure has been determined.
+  MkDepend searches the includes first in the current directory, then in
+  the given paths (if any), imitating the C preprocessor's behaviour.
+  The files are scanned for include statements of the form
+
+    #include &quot;filename&quot;
+    #include &lt;filename&gt;
+
+  excluding those which are commented out using C-style /* */- or
+  C++-style //-comments. Every other content of the files is ignored.
+
+  After all includes have been found, the dependencies are written into
+  a makefile (creating it if necessary). The makefile is searched for
+  a line
+
+    # --- DO NOT MODIFY THIS LINE -- AUTO-DEPENDS FOLLOW ---
+
+  after which MkDepend adds the dependencies, overwriting old ones, then
+  terminating the dependencies with the line
+
+    # --- DO NOT MODIFY THIS LINE -- AUTO-DEPENDS PRECEDE ---
+
+  Text following the second tagline in the makefile is not modified.
+
+  If the first tagline is not found, the tagged dependencies are simply
+  appended to the file. Existing makefiles are modified by renaming it
+  to &lt;origname&gt;.bak and then re-creating the makefile by copying the
+  data not to be modified.
+
+  The found dependencies for the 'skeleton' files are written as
+
+    &lt;skeleton&gt; : &lt;included file 1&gt; &lt;included file 2&gt;...
+
+  Lines are limited to 80 chars, longer entries are folded into several
+  lines, ending each but the last line with a backslash (\). If a
+  name contains spaces, it is written within double quotes.
+
+  MkDepend can be taught to know about source/object file relationships
+  to be used in the entries written. E,g, the entry generated for a typical
+  C source file would be of the form
+
+    &lt;skeleton&gt;.o : &lt;include 1&gt; &lt;include 2&gt; ...
+
+  Includes appear with that path in the list under which MkDepend found
+  them. To support multi-platform development, replacement texts may
+  be specified for the paths which are then used instead in the output.
+
+
+  For documentary purposes MkDepend may additionally (or instead) write
+  the dependencies into a separate file, either as flat lists or in
+  tree form. Here it writes the 'a includes b' relationships in the
+  form &quot;a &lt;- b&quot; as well as the 'b is included by a' relationsships
+  in the form &quot;b -&gt; a&quot;.
+
+
+Selected-File Operation
+-----------------------
+
+  MkDepend can be instructed just look for dependencies involving
+  some selected include files. This mode is activated by the use
+  of one or more '-S' arguments; and the output in this mode is
+  restricted to just the skeleton and the selected file.
+
+  For example, where a normal MkDepend run would generate
+
+    foobar.o : foobar.h yacc.tab.h main.h
+
+  call MkDepend with the argument '-S yacc.tab.h' would reduce this output
+  to
+
+    foobar.o : yacc.tab.h
+
+  In the Makefile, these selected dependencies are put between
+
+    # --- DO NOT MODIFY THIS LINE -- SELECTED AUTO-DEPENDS FOLLOW ---
+    # --- DO NOT MODIFY THIS LINE -- SELECTED AUTO-DEPENDS PRECEDE ---
+
+  delimiter lines, so that both kinds of operations can be used on the
+  same Makefile.
+
+
+  In addition, the output of the other dependency files is modified in
+  a similar way.
+
+
+Arguments
+---------
+
+  &lt;filepattern&gt;
+
+    Any command argument not recognizable as option is considered as
+    specification of one of the 'skeleton' sources.
+    Wildcards are recognized.
+
+    Default: *.c
+
+    Example:
+
+      mkdepend *.c *.cc grammar.y
+
+        All files ending in &quot;.c&quot; or &quot;.cc&quot; and the file &quot;grammar.y&quot;
+        are considered.
+
+      The expansion of the wildcards is done by the shell.
+
+   ------
+
+  -x       &lt;filepattern&gt;
+  --except &lt;filepattern&gt;
+
+    Files which are not part of the 'skeleton', even if they are specified
+    as such. The filepattern may contain the typical bash-wildcards, which
+    are expanded by MkDepend.
+
+    Example:
+
+      mkdepend *.c -x 'test*'
+
+        All files ending in &quot;.c&quot;, except those whose name start with &quot;test&quot;,
+        are considered as sources. Note the quotes around &quot;test*&quot; to protect
+        it from shell name expansion.
+
+   ------
+
+  -S       &lt;filepattern&gt;
+  --select &lt;filepattern&gt;
+
+    The output of dependency information is restricted to just those
+    'skeleton' source which include at least one of the &lt;filepattern&gt; files.
+    Furthermore, only the named files are printed in the dependency lists.
+
+    The filepattern may contain the typical bash-wildcards, which are
+    expanded by MkDepend _against the files existing at the time of
+    program start_. The pattern has to match the full filename
+    of the included file, including the directory part implicitely given
+    by any -I argument.
+
+    Example:
+
+      mkdepend *.c -S 'yacc.tab.h'
+
+        Only the files which include &quot;yacc.tab.h&quot; will be listed in the
+        output.
+
+   ------
+
+  -I        &lt;includedir&gt;[::&lt;symbol&gt;]}
+  --include &lt;includedir&gt;[::&lt;symbol&gt;]}
+
+     Specify a directory to be searched for include files. The paths are
+     searched in the order given on the command line. Unless '-I-' was
+     specified, the directory the including file is in is searched first.
+
+     If &lt;symbol&gt; is specified, it replaces the &lt;includedir&gt; when writing
+     dependencies to a makefile.
+
+     Usually, the path, made up from all given &lt;includedir&gt;s, is searched
+     fully for both &quot;&quot;- and &lt;&gt;-includes. This behaviour changes if the
+     path is split using the special dirname '-' (like in '-I-').
+
+     If '-I-' is used, all directories given before the '-I-' are searched
+     only for &quot;&quot;-includes. The directories given after the '-I-' are
+     searched for both &quot;&quot;- and &lt;&gt;-includes again. Also the directories of
+     the including files are no longer searched automatically.
+
+     If a &quot;&quot;-include is not found, MkDepend will print a warning, but
+     still list the file in the generated dependencies. Missing &lt;&gt;-includes
+     on the other hand are silently ignored.
+
+     Example:
+
+       mkdepend -I /include -I- -I libglob
+
+         &quot;&quot;-include files are searched in the current directory, in /include
+         and in libglob. &lt;&gt;-include files are searched only in the
+         current directory and libglob.
+
+       mkdepend -I '/include/pdlibs::$(PDLIBS)'
+
+         Include files are searched in the current directory and
+         in /include/pdlibs. A file like &quot;/include/pdlibs/tree.h&quot; will be
+         written as &quot;$(PDLIBS)tree.h&quot; into the makefile.
+         Again note the use of quotes to keep the shell from expanding
+         the text '$(PDLIBS)'.
+
+     Note that the syntax of this option is similar, but not identical to
+     what most compilers expect. One example of an exception is the GNU
+     C-Compiler which distinguishes between '-I' and '-i' in meaning. It is
+     therefore advisable to only use the uppercase '-I' for both compiler
