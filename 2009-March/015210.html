</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Date: 2009-03-27 12:32:09 +0100 (Fri, 27 Mar 2009) New Revision: 29744
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ViewCVS: <A HREF="http://svn.berlios.de/viewcvs/haiku?rev=29744&amp;view=rev">http://svn.berlios.de/viewcvs/haiku?rev=29744&amp;view=rev</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Modified:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   haiku/trunk/build/jam/OptionalPackages
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Log:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Patch by aljen: Added GCC4 Pe package.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Two notes by myself:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * I've changed the patch to remove code duplication. This is always 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; preferable.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My fault :)
</I>
No big deal... :-)

&gt;<i> &gt; * GCC4 packages may break, because Haiku does not claim to keep binary
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  compatibility with itself until after the R1 release. Even then we may 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  not keep it for GCC4, since Haiku will most likely be GCC2, and there 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  will be a real GCC4 switch where we will try to make API changes that 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  will be supported in future releases. So GCC4 packages should be 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  considered very carefully.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> *shrug*
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I personally don't mind recompiling stuff as necessary and providing 
</I>&gt;<i> updated packages for those who want to use GCC4 Haiku, if the source API 
</I>&gt;<i> changes, the sources for popular apps need to be updated anyway, so we 
</I>&gt;<i> might as well do it as we go if possible.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In this case, Artur provided the package, I tested it for him (and had 
</I>&gt;<i> him fix a few things), so it seems reasonable to include it :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Rene doesn't seem to have a problem maintaining GCC4 Vision, GCC4 Firefox 
</I>&gt;<i> on the other hand is sort of a large project.
</I>
It does add some extra work. If I was more serious about my commit 
priviledges, I would have had to actually test the package myself, but I 
have no GCC4 Haiku ready. So I used some trust, since I saw the package was 
already on haiku-files... :-D

&gt;<i> &gt;  In the case of Pe, there may be the benefit of faster launch times, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  since most libs will be already loaded (unlike if it's a GCC2 package 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  on a GCC4 Haiku). I am just saying the benefits need to outweight the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  additional work to maintain and test these packages.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In the case of Pe, it's very useful for anyone who wishes to work on a 
</I>&gt;<i> GCC4-only Haiku and do development - the number of portable software 
</I>&gt;<i> packages out there that require gcc3 or newer is increasing all the time, 
</I>&gt;<i> and so if we want to embrace these, we need to start seriously 
</I>&gt;<i> considering supporting GCC4 Haiku.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> all IMHO anyway, but for me GCC2 Haiku or hybrid builds is very quickly 
</I>&gt;<i> losing my interest personally.
</I>
I know where you're coming from. I started porting Beam to GCC4... until I 
finished and realized that liblayout.so will stay GCC2 and there is no 
chance of linking Beam unless I *really* port it to Haiku and it's layout 
management. That's of course a little more work than replacing a few 
&quot;vector&quot; with &quot;std::vector&quot; and similar. :-) And I do frequently use 
WonderBrush, which has the same problem... :-)

I didn't really consider clean GCC4 images, I thought everyone would use 
hybrid images. If you use a hybrid image, there is really no big difference 
in using GCC2 Pe, or is there? Now, WonderBrush would be able to use 
Translaters, which is somewhat useful. But like I said, it's much more 
work... which I need to do one day anyways... so I might as well start now. 
Although I was hoping to do an entirely new WonderBrush with a new backend 
as well.


Best regards,
-Stephan
