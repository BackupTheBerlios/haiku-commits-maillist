True. I could revert it to use auto-resizing menu fields when a BMenuField is added directly to a layout, and use full-size BMenuFields when the layout items are used. Or simply make this configurable (fixedSize flag in layout-mode constructors). But the problem I have with this is the added inconsistency. It's then up to the programmer's aesthetic decision. So there will be GUIs using either option.

&gt;<i> Have you had a look at Mail? All menu fields use exactly as much space 
</I>&gt;<i> as their current active item needs - that's not fixed size, right?
</I>
Yep. But you must be talking about the Prefs window. In the main Mail window, the BMenuFields which are not used as labels (From, Encoding) are fixed/full size BMenuFields. And they do help make the GUI appear less cluttered. And I am really wondering if that wouldn't be the case for the Prefs window either. The Prefs window has some more issues one could talk about. For example, the programmers found it more pleasing to make the labels right-aligned. Hm. Another aspect of the Look&amp;Feel up for inconsistency.

&gt;<i> In any case, when there are many menu fields like this, I think it 
</I>&gt;<i> looks much better this way; only the left margin is aligned, not the 
</I>&gt;<i> right one.
</I>
In this particular case of the Prefs window, where there is only one column of controls and one center of alignment, it may make look good. However I think that when there are more levels of alignment, ie multiple columns of controls and such, it makes things look more cluttered. I am tempted to make the Prefs window use layout-mode just to see what I would like better...

Best regards,
-Stephan
