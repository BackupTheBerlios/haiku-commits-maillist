</I>
People already complained about this getting put in libbe (though
frankly I don't see the big deal.)

The problem with a static library that encompasses all of the
src/shared directory into a libshared.a (as suggested by Axel) is that
applications would have to include the whole library, even though they
may not use all the code. We don't know how big the shared source
directory might be in the future, and I for one don't want to bloat
the applications with unused code. I suppose each bit of shared code
could be put in its own library (grouping things that belong
together.)

I'm open to suggestions.

&gt;<i> Besides that I'd remove the rule completely and rather put those sources into

</I>
Yeah that is just our coding guidelines, I should have caught that. I
use underscores at work when writing Ruby, so it is just a habit.

&gt;<i> * In new rules please use named parameters.
</I>&gt;<i> * There's no reason to iterate over the sources in this case. You're doing
</I>&gt;<i> the exactly same operations for all elements anyway. So you can as well
</I>&gt;<i> operate on the array directly. Which is more efficient.
</I>
OK.

&gt;<i> * There's no reason for setting both SEARCH and LOCATE on any target. In case
</I>&gt;<i> of generated files it's LOCATE, otherwise SEARCH. There's no point in setting
</I>&gt;<i> SEARCH_SOURCE on a target at all.
</I>
Actually it only works right when LOCATE is set as well. I guess Jam
considers the source file to have been generated and so setting LOCATE
to the src/shared directory finally made this work. The setting of
SEARCH and SEARCH_SOURCE could probably be removed. I tried all kinds
of variations on setting SEARCH but it never seemed to work. I guess
this is all moot anyhow.

In regards to headers/shared, I just saw that mentioned somewhere as
the directory to use for the shared headers. I know of the existence
of private/shared and had the header there at first ;)
