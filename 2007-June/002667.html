Thumbs up. :)

I don't think its a good idea to expose people to more tech lingo such 
as Replicants, Desktop Applets, etc. We should try to simpify.

Have you considered the name Utilities? It would fit and would also 
cover some of the tools that might come in the future and that won't be 
-Applications- in the sense that WonderBrush is. 

<A HREF="http://rocbo.lautre.net/macos_X/se/applic.html">http://rocbo.lautre.net/macos_X/se/applic.html</A>
GIMP, FireFox, iPhoto, are applications. The ones in the second 
picture, including Terminal, are utilities. In MacOS X, FWIW.

I don't mean that Utilities should be a subfolder of Applications in 
Deskbar. Just pointing out the classification/organization of programs 
as either Applications or Utilities.

&gt;<i> * some apps have been hidden:
</I>&gt;<i>   - ShowImage and Expander are usually not
</I>&gt;<i>     directly started on their own, but through double clicking 
</I>&gt;<i> documents
</I>
IMO, ShowImage and Expander would be utilities.

&gt;<i>   - AboutSystem is invoked elsewhere from the Leaf menu,
</I>&gt;<i>   so it doesn't need to clutter the Applications menu
</I>
Not sure how to classify AboutSystem. BApplication as it may be, it's 
neither &quot;application&quot; nor utility. It's more like part of the &quot;system&quot;, 
so I would put it alongside Tracker and Deskbar. :P

&gt;<i> * we almost introduced a third category for rarely used apps, but in 
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i>   end it would only have contained Installer, Icon-O-Matic and 
</I>&gt;<i> Diskprobe,
</I>&gt;<i>   and we felt that it is ok to leave these in the Applications menu, 
</I>&gt;<i> as long
</I>&gt;<i>   as their number is small
</I>
These too would be utilities to me, but I suppose it depends on who you 
are and how you use your computer. Maybe there's someone out there who 
uses DiskProbe all day long.
