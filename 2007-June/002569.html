Yeah but the line between what was standard third party stuff and OS
stuff back in the Be days has changed. Though we need to be careful
about going too crazy in implementing everything within or with the
OS.

&gt;<i> My general opinion is that if something should be a added to a

</I>
Yeah that makes sense.

I'm sort of on the fence on this playlist thing. A lot of times I will
listen to music in directory order (which is usually the CD track
order), so playing from a directory would be fine. But sometimes I
want to mix things up by re-arranging a song or two. Not having that
option would annoy me. Maybe there is a way to do both without getting
too confusing or complicated?

But I agree it is definitely the &quot;Be way&quot; to have a playlist from a
directory listing or a query result.

&gt;<i> Sometimes what people want isn't the right thing. People wanted
</I>&gt;<i> Single Window Navigation, which IMO is not in line with classic
</I>&gt;<i> BeOS, or the MacOS it was meant to replace.
</I>
I know what you mean, but that sounds pretty elitist. Regardless of
whether it seems &quot;right&quot; or not, if users want or prefer something,
that should be seriously considered.
