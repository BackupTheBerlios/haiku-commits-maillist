<PRE>2007/6/17, Travis Geiselbrecht &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/haiku-commits">geist at foobox.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The two obvious options with only local changes would be:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * Use the block number as cookie value -- or rather block number +
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1, so
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that the initial cookie value can be discriminated. This allows for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a quick
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; lookup (hash_lookup(cache-&gt;hash, &amp;blockNumber)) and requires only
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; minimal
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; changes. The only drawback is that it limits the number of addressable
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; blocks to 2^32 - 2. For a 1 KB block size that's still a partition
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; size of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; almost 4 TB, which shouldn't be too bad for the time being.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * Use the list index as cookie value. I don't know, how many blocks a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; transaction will usually contain. Might be a performance problem.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Either change should be conditional, so that 32 bit hosts won't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; suffer from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the drawbacks.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Other options that require more changes:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * Assign unique 32 bit numbers to blocks and add an additional hash
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; table
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to block_cache.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * Add a block list index -&gt; cache_block* hash map to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; cache_transaction.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I suppose the ideal solution would be to change the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; cache_next_block_in_transaction() interface, e.g. to using a void*
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; cookie.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another option would be to simply make the cookie a uint64. I
</I>&gt;<i> actually got most of the build working properly on x86-64 yesterday,
</I>&gt;<i> took a while to debug, but I didn't check them in yet, since they
</I>&gt;<i> were pretty nasty.
</I>

I wouldn't mind. Axel, do you have an opinion here ?

Here were the changes I had to make to get it to build:
&gt;<i> -moved this cookie to uint64, in every instance of it (the fssh cache
</I>&gt;<i> and the real one)
</I>&gt;<i> -all of the error codes needed to be based on INT_MIN not LONG_MIN.
</I>&gt;<i> There's about 4 places in the source that do this, and it seems like
</I>&gt;<i> a pretty major change, though I can't see it really causing any
</I>&gt;<i> problems. It was inheirited from beos.
</I>

I found only one place where it should be important :
headers/build/os/support/Errors.h

-in some of the places where we typedef uint32, we are typedefing it
&gt;<i> to unsigned long. This is obviously incorrect on a 64bit platform,
</I>&gt;<i> but it's a pretty major change that causes a lot of problems later
</I>&gt;<i> down the road. such as...
</I>

I don't think it is really important for build libbe.

-BMessage has some bad overrides of &amp;operator&lt;&lt; that when int32 is
&gt;<i> int causes a collision.
</I>

I had this on BString also ...

Also, as far as the atomic change, I think the problem there wasn't
&gt;<i> that it needed a 64bit atomic, it was that fssh_addr_t is currently
</I>&gt;<i> typedefed to uint32. I changed it to typedef to uintptr_t.
</I>

Sure, but I don't see the point of using a 32 bit atomic to set a 64 bit
pointer.

Anyway, all of this really looks like a big preview of what's to come
&gt;<i> when trying to port it all to 64bit. Seems that some of the early
</I>&gt;<i> beos decisions were slightly off, and some stuff will have to be
</I>&gt;<i> changed, but *hopefully* none of it will cause any compatibility
</I>&gt;<i> problems.
</I>

The problems we encounter now are typically for build tools.
I have a problem at the moment for resource file handling in
src/build/libbe/storage/ResourceFile.cpp where only Elf32 is handled.
Support for Elf64 is missing for the build tool &quot;makebootable&quot;

Bye,
J&#233;r&#244;me
