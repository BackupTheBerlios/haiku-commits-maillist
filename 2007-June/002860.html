There is still some stuff left to track down, feel yourself warmly 
invited ;-)

Anyway, Ingo and I have talked about the VM a bit, and planned to get 
rid of the vm_cache_ref/vm_cache differentiation (finally) and rework 
the locking model a bit.
The ref stuff actually doesn't give you a lot, but makes the whole VM a 
lot more complicated than needed.

</I>&gt;<i> which 
</I>&gt;<i> at this point I think was a misdesign of the newos vm (having it do a 
</I>&gt;<i> local 
</I>&gt;<i> page scan).
</I>
The global page scanner was the whole point of the introduction of the 
mapping code; I just haven't written it yet (but started locally some 
time ago) :-)

&gt;<i> I dont have the code in front of me, I'm at work, but I didn't really 
</I>&gt;<i> like 
</I>&gt;<i> the looks of it, though I can't quite put my finger on it yet.
</I>
I'm definitely open for suggestions once you can :-)

Bye,
   Axel.
