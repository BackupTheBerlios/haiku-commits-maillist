Sometimes it could be the desired behavior to have the player 
continue with the next video in the same folder. It depends on the
use pattern. There are many different ways to listen to music or 
watch videos.

&gt;<i> Additionally, Jonas, how would you envision creating your own
</I>&gt;<i> *sequence* of files? I mean not based on any Tracker sorting.
</I>
I guess a playlist is the only way if you want to specify an arbitrary
but exact sequence. I don't mean to say that playlists aren't 
worthwhile, but I think we rely too much on them - people having 
.m3u:s in every folder, always having to think of the playlist.

Audio file collections are by nature highly sequential. A lot of the
time I just want to listen from point X and forward, and when I get
bored I choose some other point Y and play on from there. (Why
plan and specify what I'm going to listen to when that plan is going
to change anyway before too long.)

Take shuffle. In a playlist-oriented player it's a shuffle of the 
playlist.
In a collection-oriented player (using BFS queries or an iTunes-like 
database) shuffle could be more open-ended and adapt to user 
input and refinement, like &quot;more rock&quot;, &quot;less personal favorites&quot;.

This doesn't necessarily replace the playlist. The playlist, as a 
finite
order of steps, is perfect for when you drop/open multiple files, or
when you explicity open a playlist file, but having the opening of 
single files result in a single-entry playlist when that's the least 
common use case for audio? 

Perhaps it would be confusing to have the player have all these
different modes. I don't know.

/Jonas.
