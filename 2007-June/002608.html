Yes, we also thought about queries, but not as concrete as your input. But 
after discussing this a bit, we decided to keep it simple, because we don't 
have enough apps at the moment to justify fine grained categories. This is 
of course open for change at a later point, it depends also on what we want 
to include in R1 and how much we want to dictate a layout.
But for now, we want to have the frequently used apps in one folder, 
without apps among them that you would only start at system boot (if at 
all). We also removed apps, which you only start by double clicking 
documents (ShowImage, Expander), so these are now hidden from the Leaf 
menu. Additionally to that, we want to include a simple application 
launcher, so that apps are made more readily available for drag&amp;drop.
I will commit these changes soon, we have just a few last questions to 
solve.

Best regards,
-Stephan
