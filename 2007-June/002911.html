<PRE>Hi,

I think this patch might introduce some bugs.

If you call the FinishIsochronousTransfer within the finisher thread, and
then
enter the cycle where you process all the other transfers (bulk, interrupt
and control),
where the only condition to exit from that cycle is the ending of transfers
to be processed,
you might not get out soon from that cycle if requests keeps coming from a
driver. Think
about an user using an external USB disk. Wouldn't that generate many bulk
and control
requests? This way, if an user also have a webcam attached to the same
controller, images would
get processed with less priority than the data being moved in and out from
the USB disk. The same
would happen with an USB modem.

When you enter the FinishIsochronousTransfers you call the LockIsochronous,
but this is
also called again in the FindIsochronousTransfer. Doesn't it cause a
dead-lock?

The same Lock, also prevents the driver to submit another isochronous
transfer,
until all 1024 frame are being processed. I don't think this is a good
solution, because it would increase
the latency, and perhaps having bad perfomances when working with usb
webcams.

By removing the check on the controller position, I think you generate a
race condition when you unlink
the descriptor. Since the controller is never stopped (by the way we should
do that, I mean stop it when
there are no transfers), you don't know where it is, and a descriptor not
being active does not mean the
controller has already process it and moved on. The descriptor active bit,
is also set off when the isochronous
transfer is removed. This way you could unlink the descriptor while the
controller is processing the descriptor
right before this one. I know chances are very low, but we all know Murphy's
law :-)
Besides I just noticed, actually I remembered, that the unlink descriptor
function is designed to remove the
descriptor at the first position of the frame, while now it is called as
soon as a not active descriptor is found, which
is not necessarily the first one of the frame.

Last but not least :-) I'd like to know what was wrong with the previous
implementation?
I thought that having another thread would improve performances on a
multiprocessor machine.

Regards
Salvo
