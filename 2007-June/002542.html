</I>
Either option would be fine, as long as the user was given clear 
feedback about what was happening. I can definitely see the user often 
wanting to insert new files into a playlist by dropping them into the 
correct place in the playlist window, which would be indicated by a line 
in between the current items where the new ones would be inserted. On 
the other hand, complete replacement would be indicated by a box around 
the entire playlist list view (and perhaps fading out the current 
options too to indicate they will disappear from the list if the user 
continues).

I don't think that having different behaviour depending on the target is 
confusing - the playlist is the ordered list of files, so trying to drag 
files there to me implies &quot;insert these files here in this list&quot;. 
Dragging to the media player window implies &quot;you there, play this file now&quot;.

In fact I would might remove the modifiers and just have dragging to 
main window replacing the list, and dragging to the list inserting new 
files. I'd still use the technique of fading out the current playlist 
items when the user is dragging files onto the main window to give an 
indication of what will happen (and a hint of where to drag to in order 
to change the behaviour).

&gt;&gt;<i> It may seem inconsistent but it makes sense that dragging files onto
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the media player itself replaces the current playing file, whereas
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dragging onto a playlist should always append to the playlist, not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> replace it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Whatever we end up with, I am strongly considering having an Undo/Redo 
</I>&gt;<i> stack for operations in the Playlist window anyways. I know how frustrating 
</I>&gt;<i> it can be to lose changes on a complicated playlist.
</I>
Yes that would be great. Perhaps whenever a multi-file playlist is 
replaced, auto-save it somewhere for future use.
