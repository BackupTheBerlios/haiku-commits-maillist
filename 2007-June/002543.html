[shift versus shift]
&gt;<i> Either option would be fine, as long as the user was given clear

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think that having different behaviour depending on the target is

</I>&gt;<i> Dragging to the media player window implies &quot;you there, play this file now&quot;.

</I>&gt;<i> In fact I would might remove the modifiers and just have dragging to

</I>
All of the above is/was implemented except for graying out the existing items 
when you hover over the player window. The only addition now to what you say 
above is that you *can* optionally press shift to get the other behaviour, 
but since doing both is now possible without any modifier, I guess it is fine 
like it is.

The drag feedback already worked exactly like you discribe, minus the graying 
out.

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; It may seem inconsistent but it makes sense that dragging files onto
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the media player itself replaces the current playing file, whereas
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; dragging onto a playlist should always append to the playlist, not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; replace it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Whatever we end up with, I am strongly considering having an Undo/Redo
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; stack for operations in the Playlist window anyways. I know how 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; frustrating
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it can be to lose changes on a complicated playlist.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes that would be great. Perhaps whenever a multi-file playlist is
</I>&gt;<i> replaced, auto-save it somewhere for future use.
</I>
I will allow to load/save playlists (not yet implemented). I don't think 
autosaving is a good idea. Having undo/redo will solve the problem of 
accidentally wiping your minute list. Actually, I use custom playlists almost 
never. Maybe at parties. Usually I just drag an album into the player. I 
wouldn't want that to get saved somewhere.

Best regards,
