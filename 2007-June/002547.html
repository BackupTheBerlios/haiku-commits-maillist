</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In fact I would might remove the modifiers and just have dragging to

Great. I'll remember to check what's already there in future. Nice that 
it was already so similar to how I feel it should be - that's definitely 
one of my favourite things about Haiku, doing these little things correctly.

&gt;<i> The drag feedback already worked exactly like you discribe, minus the graying 
</I>&gt;<i> out.
</I>
The fact replacement needs a modifier for playlist drops probably means 
the change in feedback from insertion line to box does enough to imply 
the whole list will be replaced. It might still be a nice addition though.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> It may seem inconsistent but it makes sense that dragging files onto
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the media player itself replaces the current playing file, whereas
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> dragging onto a playlist should always append to the playlist, not
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> replace it.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Whatever we end up with, I am strongly considering having an Undo/Redo
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> stack for operations in the Playlist window anyways. I know how 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> frustrating
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> it can be to lose changes on a complicated playlist.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yes that would be great. Perhaps whenever a multi-file playlist is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> replaced, auto-save it somewhere for future use.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I will allow to load/save playlists (not yet implemented). I don't think 
</I>&gt;<i> autosaving is a good idea. Having undo/redo will solve the problem of 
</I>&gt;<i> accidentally wiping your minute list. Actually, I use custom playlists almost 
</I>&gt;<i> never. Maybe at parties. Usually I just drag an album into the player. I 
</I>&gt;<i> wouldn't want that to get saved somewhere.
</I>
Yes I'd not really thought through the autosaving. I was thinking it 
might avoid having to go back through undoing every individual addition 
in the current playlist to get to the one that was previously replaced. 
Maybe actions could be grouped a bit in the undo stack to help - so 
perhaps any set of consecutive actions becomes one undo step. Hmm that's 
probably not a good idea either.
