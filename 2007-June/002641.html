 &lt;para&gt;Merely knowing what kind of window look and feel to use in a given situation is not enough: you also have to be aware of resizing, zooming, moving, closing, and minimizing because they affect your program in different ways. Once you know what kind of window you need, you should also figure out what its initial size and location are going to be. You also should not restrict the other actions a user can perform on a window unless you have a good reason that does not include &quot;I don't want to write code to handle this.&quot;&lt;/para&gt;
 
-&lt;para&gt;Care should be given to what name is used for a window. The main window of your program should use your program's name. Windows which were opened from a menu item should have the same name as that of the menu item without the ellipsis. Document windows should use the document's name. New documents should use the name &quot;Untitled&quot; with subsequent new documents appending a number. The first untitled document should not have a number. A titled window should never have an empty title bar.&lt;/para&gt;

Windows which were opened from a menu item should have the same name as that of the menu item without the ellipsis. Document windows should include the document's name. The first new document in the application should use the name &quot;Untitled&quot; with subsequent new documents appending a number. A titled window should never have an empty title bar.&lt;/para&gt;
 
-&lt;para&gt;The size of a window depends on a number of factors. An application window should have an initial size which is the  minimum needed to see all controls in it without overcrowding. Controls should never overlap. This initial size should also be the minimum size for the window which is passed to SetSizeLimits. The initial size for a document window should be large enough to see the entire document or at least a significant portion of the document if it is larger than the screen. Do not arbitrarily restrict resizing unless it does not make sense to allow resizing in a particular direction. If a window allows resizing, its size should generally be saved when closed or the program quits and restored to that size when shown again.&lt;/para&gt;

-&lt;para&gt;Zooming is similar to resizing, but there are differences in which should permit zooming and how it should be done. Utility windows, for example, are not intended to be the main focus of the program, so they should not allow zooming even though they should allow resizing except where inappropriate. Document windows should expand to fill the largest sensible space to allow editing. Often times this is the entire screen, but it may not be. Word processors will probably move to the top of the screen, resize the width to the maximum width of the current document's view, and resize the height to the bottom of the screen.&lt;/para&gt;

Word processors, for example, will probably move the document window to the top of the screen, resize the width to the maximum width of the current document's view, and resize the height to the bottom of the screen.&lt;/para&gt;
 
 &lt;para&gt;The placement of a window on the screen also varies depending on its usage. Program windows should initially either show themselves in the center of the screen or just a little above it. The same goes for the initial placement of a document window. Additional document windows should duplicate the most recent document window's frame offset by 15 pixels in both directions. As with size, a program should generally remember the screen placement of the windows and movement should not be restricted unless there is a good reason for it.&lt;/para&gt;
 
 &lt;para&gt;A window need not always be visible. Duh. Considering that it can be hidden or closed altogether may be a bit confusing. Generally, a document should allow minimizing to make it possible for the user to get the document &quot;out of the way&quot; for a moment without having to close it entirely. Utility windows and program windows which are not the main window should normally not permit minimizing and just allow closing. The main window should allow minimizing. Note that when a program is not the focus, utility windows with the Floating:Subset and Floating:App behaviors will be hidden. Windows should normally be allowed to close unless there is a very good reason for it.&lt;/para&gt;
 
-&lt;para&gt;A number of times it has been mentioned that you should not prevent something unless there is sufficient reason to do so. Particularly on other platforms, developers have been known to just disallow resizing because they didn't want to bother themselves with writing handler code. There are other instances where, for example, a window could not be closed because the code had a design flaw which would cause a crash if the window were closed. Remember: the more work you do in making your program helpful means the less work the user has to do which means that your program is easier to use.&lt;/para&gt;

-&lt;para&gt;In MacOS X, the feature this flag enables is called click-through. It means that clicking on the window passes the click through to the control the mouse was under at the time even when the window does not have the focus. As a rule, this behavior should not be used, but there are times when it is quite useful, such as for system monitor programs, the Deskbar, and so forth.&lt;/para&gt;

Occasionally, there is a need to force the user to make a decision before moving on. This is an appropriate time to use a modal window. The need is far less often than what most would believe, however. Most of the time the only reason to use a modal window would be if not doing so would make potential for the user to lose data and there is nothing that can be done to the code architecture to prevent it. This follows the &quot;no restrictions for no good reason&quot; way of thinking mentioned above -- modal windows place restrictions on what windows he can or can't click on. &lt;/para&gt;

-&lt;para&gt;Alert windows are the single easiest way to make usability mistakes. Most often, they are used to show error messages. The problem is that they are used *far* more often than they should be and the error messages that are used in them are too technical for a regular user to understand. They are also used to ask the user a question. More often than not, the question that is asked could have just as easily been answered by the developer had he thought ahead a bit.

 &lt;title&gt;Installation and Updates&lt;/title&gt;
 
-&lt;para&gt;It is easy to get so wrapped up in developing great software that you forget about getting it onto a user's computer. It pays to pay attention to detail in the installation of your software -- if a user can't get your program to work on his machine, you've just managed to both hurt your reputation as a developer and probably lose a user at the same time. Installation is one of those elements of software development that is given little, if any, attention when it works well but is quickly noticed when something goes wrong. As of this writing, there are two main methods of packaging and installing software on BeOS-based operating systems: zip files and Software Valet packages. &lt;/para&gt;

 &lt;title&gt;Getting Program Updates&lt;/title&gt;
 
-&lt;para&gt;While there is no official support from the operating system, a conscientious developer will make a way for the user to easily update your program. Ideally, your program should automatically check for updates, ask the user if he would like to download them, download them in the background, and then install the updates when your program closes. Providing a way to roll back the updates in case of something going seriously wrong is also a very good idea. The only problem with this kind of setup is that it is a *lot* of work.&lt;/para&gt;

Providing a way to roll back the updates in case of something going seriously wrong is also a very good idea. The only problem with this kind of setup is that it is a *lot* of work.&lt;/para&gt;
 
 &lt;para&gt;Because of the popularity of BeOS download sites such as BeBits, it is relatively simple to post updates merely by releasing the new version on such sites. It places the check-download-install responsibility on the user, though. More motivated users will update their software; a great many users will not, so keep this in mind if this is the route you would choose to go.&lt;/para&gt;
