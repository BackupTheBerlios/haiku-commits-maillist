Two separate issues here:

A. Having an application named &quot;NetPositive&quot; open a window
named &quot;Net Positive&quot; is just inconsistent and probably makes
the unconscious (and sometimes conscious) mind waste time
on a distinction between the two variations which is probably
pointless for both creator and user. I suspect mixing the two 
adds to mental background noise. 

B. If you try a new OS with applications you've never used
before and never heard about, does it help you that they're
called e.g. Gulliver, flatfoot, SnakeTP, wiXzzer, GoodMorning?
That would be non-conformist, but it would also be aginst
common-sense and work against human nature.

I know I feel more at ease when the latest Linux distro I try
has names and icons that least -hint- the purpose of the apps.

I'm -only- talking about the -included- Haiku applications, 
which are usually limited in scope and which mostly have
short, meaningful, self-describing names already.

While there may be a very small difference between, say
&quot;Icon-O-Matic&quot; and say &quot;IconMaker&quot; I think it may be a good
idea, for the user experience as a whole, to try to streamline
the names (distilling their essence) so that the full lineup of 
application names makes sense and reaches the desired 
level of consistency.

CodyCam sticks out simply because there's nothing &quot;Cody&quot;
about the application anymore. Few people know who Cody
is/was. It just doesn't make sense to perpetuate this name. 
The gain in clarity by renaming the application (to e.g. 
WebcamUploader, WebcamPublisher, or whatever) 
outweighs this small damage to Haiku's BeOS heritage, IMO.

This is slightly related to:
The Nefarious Baron Owns Your Files!&quot;

Why expose possibly millions of people to similar old 
workplace nostalgia? No disregard to the BeOS developers,
management, interns, ... but we've go to move on. Honestly.

Haiku has room for improvement in soft issues, without going
flat-out GlassElevator about things. It's simple things really, like
filenames, filetype names, sensible keyboard  shortcuts, 
meaningful icons, good window behaviour. Some amount of 
consistent behaviour. GUI component reuse. Etc.
