It definitely needs some work, yes. I still think it's worth it, though 
:<i>-)
</I>

</I>
Actually, it has very similar dependencies - both need areas to work 
with. If your 2 MB grow heap is empty, we're screwed, too, right? The 
same approach would work (for some time) for the slab allocator.

&gt;<i> allocations up to one page. I doubt that switching to a more complex
</I>&gt;<i> implementation for these would bring any real benefit. Also since the 
</I>&gt;<i> heaps
</I>&gt;<i> can simply be attached to memory ranges, it is easily possible to 
</I>&gt;<i> implement
</I>&gt;<i> additional features, like to create allocators tied to CPUs to reduce 
</I>&gt;<i> false
</I>&gt;<i> cache line sharing. It would be a simple extension to the current 
</I>&gt;<i> memalign()
</I>&gt;<i> function. For this to be useful though, we first need some CPU 
</I>&gt;<i> affinity, so
</I>&gt;<i> that threads do not constantly migrate and could actually make use a 
</I>&gt;<i> CPU
</I>&gt;<i> specific allocator.
</I>
A CPU specific allocator also has the advantage that you can allocate 
and free resources lockless; CPU affinity is definitely a plus in this 
scenario, too, but it's not mandatory.

&gt;<i> On the large allocation front (bigger than one page) the heap is 
</I>&gt;<i> currently not
</I>&gt;<i> that efficient though. It works well, but there are some linear 
</I>&gt;<i> searches
</I>&gt;<i> involved that do not scale (though I still have some ideas to speed 
</I>&gt;<i> that up).
</I>&gt;<i> So a useful thing for the future would be to move to a &quot;dual 
</I>&gt;<i> allocator&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> approach, where the heap is used for all small allocations and a slab 
</I>&gt;<i> or other
</I>&gt;<i> allocator for everything else. From my observations, the vast 
</I>&gt;<i> majority of
</I>&gt;<i> allocations is in the very small area though, so for large 
</I>&gt;<i> allocations it
</I>&gt;<i> could even be argued to simply create areas.
</I>
The slab allocator is very efficient for both, small allocations and 
large allocations, depending on how the underlying memory allocation is 
working (right now, it's not so good, because area creation is 
expansive).
Anyway, in the long run I would like to have only one allocator if 
possible. It's not as urgent anymore now, though.

&gt;<i> By the way there are now leak checking functions implemented that can 
</I>&gt;<i> track
</I>&gt;<i> open allocations and filter by team or thread id (has to be enabled 
</I>&gt;<i> by the
</I>&gt;<i> corresponding define at the top of heap.cpp). Also combined with heap 
</I>&gt;<i> tracing
</I>&gt;<i> it is possible to easily get the context of allocations to help find 
</I>&gt;<i> out where
</I>&gt;<i> the leak started. I found one in BFS this way and hope that it will 
</I>&gt;<i> be useful
</I>&gt;<i> to others too.
</I>
I noticed, and already turned that feature on :-)

Bye,
   Axel.
