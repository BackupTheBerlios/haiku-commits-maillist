&gt;<i> Hi kirilla,
</I> ... 
&gt;<i> &gt; Log:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The title of the (primary) window of (non-document) 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; apps and preferences should be the filename of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; executable. 
</I>
I think its pretty standard, logical and acceptable that the
name of the application should be the same regardless
of where its presented, be it filename, window tab, about-
window or some other place.

 ...
&gt;<i> &gt; Sorry, Marcus, for changing TV-O-Rama. :/ 
</I>
Maybe I overstepped my informal boundaries, 
but as I see it Marcus has given the app to Haiku.
The project as a whole has ownership and is free 
to rename it. I am not the project, but the project is
moved forward by individual commits, and usually 
not by discussion. Feel free to revert though. I fully
understand if Marcus wants his creation to be called
TV-O-Rama and if other people want to respect his
wishes, or simply consider TV-O-Rama to be a good
name. 

For the record though, IIRC, the filename of TV-O-Rama
was &quot;TV&quot;, as was the link to it in Haiku's application menu.
The jam target is &quot;TV&quot; and the source folder is &quot;tv&quot;.

So I changed TV-O-Rama to match the filename, just like 
the rest of the apps in my commit. 

&gt;<i> We may want to consider using more proper language,
</I>&gt;<i> e.g. 'Screensaver' or 'Screen Saver' instead of 
</I>&gt;<i> 'ScreenSaver'.
</I> ...
&gt;<i> I just noticed the original message of this thread, where 
</I>&gt;<i> the names have already been changed.
</I>
FWIW, I merely removed inconsistency in the names. 
(I didn't invent new names.)
 
&gt;<i> May I (as gently as possible :) ) suggest that you ask 
</I>&gt;<i> before making this sort of changes? 
</I>
Consider my commits suggestions.

These aren't large changes, really, 
but it's necessary polish, IMO.

&gt;<i> Not that I am for or against them, but I think the flow for
</I>&gt;<i> this sort of thing should be to propose, discuss and then
</I>&gt;<i> act based on the result of the discussion, not the other 
</I>&gt;<i> way around. :)
</I>
I wish I had all that time back which I spent over the years 
on the BeOS mailinglists in endless and fruitless discussion.
The people who just go ahead and do stuff usually succeed.

I agree that many things need consensus, but its a lot more
efficient to allow the people who care the most to drive
development of the areas where consensus isn't crucial at
every incremental step, and it's usually not impossible to 
revert bad changes.

/Jonas.
