+Notes on the Free Translation Project
+*************************************
+
+   Free software is going international!  The Free Translation Project
+is a way to get maintainers of free software, translators, and users all
+together, so that will gradually become able to speak many languages.
+A few packages already provide translations for their messages.
+
+   If you found this `ABOUT-NLS' file inside a distribution, you may
+assume that the distributed package does use GNU `gettext' internally,
+itself available at your nearest GNU archive site.  But you do _not_
+need to install GNU `gettext' prior to configuring, installing or using
+this package with messages translated.
+
+   Installers will find here some useful hints.  These notes also
+explain how users should proceed for getting the programs to use the
+available translations.  They tell how people wanting to contribute and
+work at translations should contact the appropriate team.
+
+   When reporting bugs in the `intl/' directory or bugs which may be
+related to internationalization, you should tell about the version of
+`gettext' which is used.  The information can be found in the
+`intl/VERSION' file, in internationalized packages.
+
+Quick configuration advice
+==========================
+
+   If you want to exploit the full power of internationalization, you
+should configure it using
+
+     ./configure --with-included-gettext
+
+to force usage of internationalizing routines provided within this
+package, despite the existence of internationalizing capabilities in the
+operating system where this package is being installed.  So far, only
+the `gettext' implementation in the GNU C library version 2 provides as
+many features (such as locale alias, message inheritance, automatic
+charset conversion or plural form handling) as the implementation here.
+It is also not possible to offer this additional functionality on top
+of a `catgets' implementation.  Future versions of GNU `gettext' will
+very likely convey even more functionality.  So it might be a good idea
+to change to GNU `gettext' as soon as possible.
+
+   So you need _not_ provide this option if you are using GNU libc 2 or
+you have installed a recent copy of the GNU gettext package with the
+included `libintl'.
+
+INSTALL Matters
+===============
+
+   Some packages are &quot;localizable&quot; when properly installed; the
+programs they contain can be made to speak your own native language.
+Most such packages use GNU `gettext'.  Other packages have their own
+ways to internationalization, predating GNU `gettext'.
+
+   By default, this package will be installed to allow translation of
+messages.  It will automatically detect whether the system already
+provides the GNU `gettext' functions.  If not, the GNU `gettext' own
+library will be used.  This library is wholly contained within this
+package, usually in the `intl/' subdirectory, so prior installation of
+the GNU `gettext' package is _not_ required.  Installers may use
+special options at configuration time for changing the default
+behaviour.  The commands:
+
+     ./configure --with-included-gettext
+     ./configure --disable-nls
+
+will respectively bypass any pre-existing `gettext' to use the
+internationalizing routines provided within this package, or else,
+_totally_ disable translation of messages.
+
+   When you already have GNU `gettext' installed on your system and run
+configure without an option for your new package, `configure' will
+probably detect the previously built and installed `libintl.a' file and
+will decide to use this.  This might be not what is desirable.  You
+should use the more recent version of the GNU `gettext' library.  I.e.
+if the file `intl/VERSION' shows that the library which comes with this
+package is more recent, you should use
+
+     ./configure --with-included-gettext
+
+to prevent auto-detection.
+
+   The configuration process will not test for the `catgets' function
+and therefore it will not be used.  The reason is that even an
+emulation of `gettext' on top of `catgets' could not provide all the
+extensions of the GNU `gettext' library.
+
+   Internationalized packages have usually many `po/LL.po' files, where
+LL gives an ISO 639 two-letter code identifying the language.  Unless
+translations have been forbidden at `configure' time by using the
+`--disable-nls' switch, all available translations are installed
+together with the package.  However, the environment variable `LINGUAS'
+may be set, prior to configuration, to limit the installed set.
+`LINGUAS' should then contain a space separated list of two-letter
+codes, stating which languages are allowed.
+
+Using This Package
+==================
+
+   As a user, if your language has been installed for this package, you
+only have to set the `LANG' environment variable to the appropriate
+`LL_CC' combination.  Here `LL' is an ISO 639 two-letter language code,
+and `CC' is an ISO 3166 two-letter country code.  For example, let's
+suppose that you speak German and live in Germany.  At the shell
+prompt, merely execute `setenv LANG de_DE' (in `csh'),
+`export LANG; LANG=de_DE' (in `sh') or `export LANG=de_DE' (in `bash').
+This can be done from your `.login' or `.profile' file, once and for
+all.
+
+   You might think that the country code specification is redundant.
+But in fact, some languages have dialects in different countries.  For
+example, `de_AT' is used for Austria, and `pt_BR' for Brazil.  The
+country code serves to distinguish the dialects.
+
+   The locale naming convention of `LL_CC', with `LL' denoting the
+language and `CC' denoting the country, is the one use on systems based
+on GNU libc.  On other systems, some variations of this scheme are
+used, such as `LL' or `LL_CC.ENCODING'.  You can get the list of
+locales supported by your system for your country by running the command
+`locale -a | grep '^LL''.
+
+   Not all programs have translations for all languages.  By default, an
+English message is shown in place of a nonexistent translation.  If you
+understand other languages, you can set up a priority list of languages.
+This is done through a different environment variable, called
+`LANGUAGE'.  GNU `gettext' gives preference to `LANGUAGE' over `LANG'
+for the purpose of message handling, but you still need to have `LANG'
+set to the primary language; this is required by other parts of the
+system libraries.  For example, some Swedish users who would rather
+read translations in German than English for when Swedish is not
+available, set `LANGUAGE' to `sv:de' while leaving `LANG' to `sv_SE'.
+
+   In the `LANGUAGE' environment variable, but not in the `LANG'
+environment variable, `LL_CC' combinations can be abbreviated as `LL'
+to denote the language's main dialect.  For example, `de' is equivalent
+to `de_DE' (German as spoken in Germany), and `pt' to `pt_PT'
+(Portuguese as spoken in Portugal) in this context.
+
+Translating Teams
+=================
+
+   For the Free Translation Project to be a success, we need interested
+people who like their own language and write it well, and who are also
+able to synergize with other translators speaking the same language.
+Each translation team has its own mailing list.  The up-to-date list of
+teams can be found at the Free Translation Project's homepage,
+`<A HREF="http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/contrib/po/HTML/">http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/contrib/po/HTML/</A>', in the &quot;National teams&quot;
+area.
+
+   If you'd like to volunteer to _work_ at translating messages, you
+should become a member of the translating team for your own language.
+The subscribing address is _not_ the same as the list itself, it has
+`-request' appended.  For example, speakers of Swedish can send a
+message to `<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/haiku-commits">sv-request at li.org</A>', having this message body:
+
+     subscribe
+
+   Keep in mind that team members are expected to participate
+_actively_ in translations, or at solving translational difficulties,
+rather than merely lurking around.  If your team does not exist yet and
+you want to start one, or if you are unsure about what to do or how to
+get started, please write to `<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/haiku-commits">translation at iro.umontreal.ca</A>' to reach the
+coordinator for all translator teams.
+
+   The English team is special.  It works at improving and uniformizing
+the terminology in use.  Proven linguistic skill are praised more than
+programming skill, here.
+
+Available Packages
+==================
+
+   Languages are not equally supported in all packages.  The following
+matrix shows the current state of internationalization, as of May 2003.
+The matrix shows, in regard of each package, for which languages PO
+files have been submitted to translation coordination, with a
+translation percentage of at least 50%.

+   Some counters in the preceding matrix are higher than the number of
+visible blocks let us expect.  This is because a few extra PO files are
+used for implementing regional variants of languages, or language
+dialects.
+
+   For a PO file in the matrix above to be effective, the package to
+which it applies should also have been internationalized and
+distributed as such by its maintainer.  There might be an observable
+lag between the mere existence a PO file and its wide availability in a
+distribution.
+
+   If May 2003 seems to be old, you may fetch a more recent copy of
+this `ABOUT-NLS' file on most GNU archive sites.  The most up-to-date
+matrix with full percentage details can be found at

+
+Using `gettext' in new packages
+===============================
+
+   If you are writing a freely available program and want to
+internationalize it you are welcome to use GNU `gettext' in your
+package.  Of course you have to respect the GNU Library General Public
+License which covers the use of the GNU `gettext' library.  This means
+in particular that even non-free programs can use `libintl' as a shared
+library, whereas only free software can use `libintl' as a static
+library or use modified versions of `libintl'.
+
+   Once the sources are changed appropriately and the setup can handle
+the use of `gettext' the only thing missing are the translations.  The
+Free Translation Project is also available for packages which are not
+developed inside the GNU project.  Therefore the information given above
+applies also for every other Free Software Project.  Contact
+`<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/haiku-commits">translation at iro.umontreal.ca</A>' to make the `.pot' files available to
+the translation teams.

+This document details the changes between this version, bash-3.2-release,
+and the previous version, bash-3.2-beta.
+
+1.  Changes to Bash
+
+a.  Fixed a bug that caused the temporary environment passed to a command to
+    affect the shell's environment under certain circumstances.
+
+b.  Fixed a bug in the printf builtin that caused the %q format specifier to
+    ignore empty string arguments.
+
+c.  Improved multibyte character environment detection at configuration time.
+
+d.  Fixed a bug in the read builtin that left spurious escape characters in the
+    input after processing backslashes when assigning to an array variable.
+
+2.  Changes to Readline
+
+a.  Fixed a redisplay bug that occurred in multibyte-capable locales when the
+    prompt was one character longer than the screen width.
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+This document details the changes between this version, bash-3.2-beta,
+and the previous version, bash-3.2-alpha.
+
+1.  Changes to Bash
+
+a.  Changed the lexical analyzer to treat locale-specific blank characters as
+    white space.
+
+b.  Fixed a bug in command printing to avoid confusion between redirections and
+    process substitution.
+
+c.  Fixed problems with cross-compiling originating from inherited environment
+    variables.
+
+d.  Added write error reporting to printf builtin.
+
+e.  Fixed a bug in the variable expansion code that could cause a core dump in
+    a multi-byte locale.
+
+f.  Fixed a bug that caused substring expansion of a null string to return
+    incorrect results.
+
+g.  BASH_COMMAND now retains its previous value while executing commands as the
+    result of a trap, as the documentation states.
+
+2.  Changes to Readline
+
+a.  Fixed a bug with prompt redisplay in a multi-byte locale to avoid redrawing
+    the prompt and input line multiple times.
+
+b.  Fixed history expansion to not be confused by here-string redirection.
+
+c.  Readline no longer treats read errors by converting them to newlines, as
+    it does with EOF.  This caused partial lines to be returned from readline().
+
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+This document details the changes between this version, bash-3.2-alpha,
+and the previous version, bash-3.1-release.
+
+1.  Changes to Bash
+
+a.  Fixed a source bug that caused the minimal configuration to not compile.
+
+b.  Fixed memory leaks in error handling for the `read' builtin.
+
+c.  Changed the [[ and (( compound commands to set PIPESTATUS with their exit
+    status.
+
+d.  Fixed some parsing problems with compound array assignments.
+
+e.  Added additional configuration changes for: NetBSD (incomplete multibyte
+    character support)
+
+f.  Fixed two bugs with local array variable creation when shadowing a variable
+    of the same name from a previous context.
+
+g.  Fixed the `read' builtin to restore the correct set of completion functions
+    if a timeout occurs.
+
+h.  Added code to defer the initialization of HISTSIZE (and its stifling of the
+    history list) until the history file is loaded, allowing a startup file to
+    override the default value.
+
+i.  Tightened up the arithmetic expression parsing to produce better error
+    messages when presented with invalid operators.
+
+j.  Fixed the cross-compilation support to build the signal list at shell
+    invocation rather than compile time if cross-compiling.
+
+k.  Fixed multibyte support for non-gcc compilers (or compilers that do not
+    allow automatic array variable sizing based on a non-constant value).
+
+l.  Several fixes to the code that manages the list of terminated jobs and
+    their exit statuses, and the list of active and recently-terminated jobs
+    to avoid pid aliasing/wraparound and allocation errors.
+
+m.  Fixed a problem that allowed scripts to die due to SIGINT while waiting
+    for children, even when started in the background or otherwise ignoring
+    SIGINT.
+
+n.  Fixed a bug that caused shells invoked as -/bin/bash from not being
+    recognized as login shells.
+
+o.  Fixed a problem that caused shells in the background to give the terminal
+    to a process group other than the foreground shell process group.
+
+p.  Fixed a problem with extracting the `varname' in ${#varname}.
+
+q.  Fixed the code that handles SIGQUIT to not exit immediately -- thereby
+    calling functions that may not be called in a signal handler context --
+    but set a flag and exit afterward (like SIGINT).
+
+r.  Changed the brace expansion code to skip over braces that don't begin a
+    valid matched brace expansion construct.
+
+s.  Fixed `typeset' and `declare' to not require that their shell function
+    operands to be valid shell identifiers.
+
+t.  Changed `test' to use access(2) with a temporary uid/euid swap when testing
+    file attributes and running setuid, and access(2) in most other cases.
+
+u.  Changed completion code to not attempt command name completion on a line
+    consisting solely of whitespace when no_empty_command_completion is set.
+
+v.  The `hash' builtin now prints nothing in posix mode when the hash table is
+    empty, and prints a message to that effect to stdout instead of stderr
+    when not in posix mode.
+
+w.  Fixed a bug in the extended pattern matching code that caused it to fail to
+    match periods with certain patterns.
+
+x.  Fixed a bug that caused the shell to dump core when performing filename
+    generation in directories with thousands of files.
+
+y.  Returned to the original Bourne shell rules for parsing ``:  no recursive
+    parsing of embedded quoted strings or ${...} constructs.
+
+z.  The inheritence of the DEBUG, RETURN, and ERR traps is now dependent only
+    on the settings of the `functrace' and `errtrace' shell options, rather
+    than whether or not the shell is in debugging mode.
+
+aa. Fixed a problem with $HOME being converted to ~ in the expansion of
+    members of the DIRSTACK array.
+
+bb. Fixed a problem with quoted arguments to arithmetic expansions in certain
+    constructs.
+
+cc. The command word completion code now no longer returns matching directories
+    while searching $PATH.
+
+dd. Fixed a bug with zero-padding and precision handling in snprintf()
+    replacement.
+
+ee. Fixed a bug that caused the command substitution code not to take embedded
+    shell comments into account.
+
+ff. Fixed a bug that caused $((...);(...)) to be misinterpreted as an
+    arithmetic substitution.
+
+gg. Fixed a bug in the prompt expansion code that inappropriately added a
+    \001 before a \002 under certain circumstances.

+hh. Fixed a bug that caused `unset LANG' to not properly reset the locale
+    (previous versions would set the locale back to what it was when bash
+    was started rather than the system's &quot;native&quot; locale).
+
+ii. Fixed a bug that could cause file descriptors &gt; 10 to not be closed even
+    when closed explicitly by a script.
+
+jj. Fixed a bug that caused single quotes to be stripped from ANSI-C quoting
+    inside double-quoted command substitutions.
+
+kk. Fixed a bug that could cause core dumps when `return' was executed as the
+    last element of a pipeline inside a shell function.
+
+ll. Fixed a bug that caused DEBUG trap strings to overwrite commands stored in
+    the jobs list.
+
+2.  Changes to Readline
+
+a.  Fixed a problem that caused segmentation faults when using readline in
+    callback mode and typing consecutive DEL characters on an empty line.
+
+b.  Fixed several redisplay problems with multibyte characters, all having to
+    do with the different code paths and variable meanings between single-byte
+    and multibyte character redisplay.
+
+c.  Fixed a problem with key sequence translation when presented with the
+    sequence \M-\C-x.
+
+d.  Fixed a problem that prevented the `a' command in vi mode from being
+    undone and redone properly.
+
+e.  Fixed a problem that prevented empty inserts in vi mode from being undone
+    properly.
+
+f.  Fixed a problem that caused readline to initialize with an incorrect idea
+    of whether or not the terminal can autowrap.
+
+g.  Fixed output of key bindings (like bash `bind -p') to honor the setting of
+    convert-meta and use \e where appropriate.
+
+h.  Changed the default filename completion function to call the filename
+    dequoting function if the directory completion hook isn't set.  This means
+    that any directory completion hooks need to dequote the directory name,
+    since application-specific hooks need to know how the word was quoted,
+    even if no other changes are made.
+
+i.  Fixed a bug with creating the prompt for a non-interactive search string
+    when there are non-printing characters in the primary prompt.
+
+j.  Fixed a bug that caused prompts with invisible characters to be redrawn
+    multiple times in a multibyte locale.
+
+k.  Fixed a bug that could cause the key sequence scanning code to return the
+    wrong function.
+
+l.  Fixed a problem with the callback interface that caused it to fail when
+    using multi-character keyboard macros.
+
+m.  Fixed a bug that could cause a core dump when an edited history entry was
+    re-executed under certain conditions.
+
+n.  Fixed a bug that caused readline to reference freed memory when attmpting
+    to display a portion of the prompt.
+
+3.  New Features in Bash
+
+a.  Changed the parameter pattern replacement functions to not anchor the
+    pattern at the beginning of the string if doing global replacement - that
+    combination doesn't make any sense.
+
+b.  When running in `word expansion only' mode (--wordexp option), inhibit
+    process substitution.
+
+c.  Loadable builtins now work on MacOS X 10.[34].
+
+d.  Shells running in posix mode no longer set $HOME, as POSIX requires.
+
+e.  The code that checks for binary files being executed as shell scripts now
+    checks only for NUL rather than any non-printing character.
+
+f.  Quoting the string argument to the [[ command's  =~ operator now forces
+    string matching, as with the other pattern-matching operators.
+
+4.  New Features in Readline
+
+a.  Calling applications can now set the keyboard timeout to 0, allowing
+    poll-like behavior.
+
+b.  The value of SYS_INPUTRC (configurable at compilation time) is now used as
+    the default last-ditch startup file.
+
+c.  The history file reading functions now allow windows-like \r\n line
+    terminators.

+------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+This document details the changes between this version, bash-3.1-release,
+and the previous version, bash-3.1-rc2.
+
+1.  Changes to Readline
+
+a.  Several changes to the multibyte redisplay code to fix problems with
+    prompts containing invisible characters.
+
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+This document details the changes between this version, bash-3.1-rc2,
+and the previous version, bash-3.1-rc1.
+
+1.  Changes to Bash
+
+a.  Fixed a bug that caused a DEBUG trap to overwrite a command string that's
+    eventually attached to a background job.
+
+b.  Changed some code so that filenames with leading tildes with spaces in the
+    name aren't tilde-expanded by the bash completion code.
+
+c.  Fixed a bug that caused the pushd builtin to fail to change to
+    directories with leading `-'.
+
+d.  Fixed a small memory leak in the programmable completion code.
+
+2.  Changes to Readline
+
+a.  Fixed a redisplay bug caused by moving the cursor vertically to a line
+    with invisible characters in the prompt in a multibyte locale.
+
+b.  Fixed a bug that could cause the terminal special chars to be bound in the
+    wrong keymap in vi mode.
+
+3.  New Features in Bash
+
+a.  If compiled for strict POSIX conformance, LINES and COLUMNS may now
+    override the true terminal size.
+
+4.  New Features in Readline
+
+a.  A new external application-controllable variable that allows the LINES
+    and COLUMNS environment variables to set the window size regardless of
+    what the kernel returns.
+
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+This document details the changes between this version, bash-3.1-rc1,
+and the previous version, bash-3.1-beta1.
+
+1.  Changes to Bash
+
+a.  Fixed a bug that could cause core dumps due to accessing the current
+    pipeline while in the middle of modifying it.
+
+b.  Fixed a bug that caused pathnames with backslashes still quoting characters
+    to be passed to opendir().
+
+c.  Command word completion now obeys the setting of completion-ignore-case.
+
+d.  Fixed a problem with redirection that caused file descriptors greater than
+    2 to be inappropriately marked as close-on-exec.
+
+e.  In Posix mode, after `wait' is called to wait for a particular process
+    explicitly, that process is removed from the list of processes known to
+    the shell, and subsequent attempts to wait for it return errors.
+
+f.  Fixed a bug that caused extended pattern matching to incorrectly scan
+    backslash-escaped pattern characters.
+
+g.  Fixed a synchronization problem that could cause core dumps when handling
+    a SIGWINCH.
+
+h.  Fixed a bug that caused an unmatched backquote to be accepted without an
+    error when processing here documents.
+
+i.  Fixed a small memory leak in the `cd' builtin.
+
+j.  Fix for MacOS X so it gets the values for the HOSTTYPE, MACHTYPE, and
+    OSTYPE variables at build time, to support universal binaries.
