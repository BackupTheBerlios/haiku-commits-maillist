I started out with looking at that code, but for such a low level task it is
quite a bit too complex IMHO. The problem is that the heap is used even in the
area code, so it forms the absolute lowest primitive in memory management.
Even though the current slab has functionality to manage memory without
depending on areas it would probably need some work the get it going as a heap
replacement that performs as efficient.

The reworked heap on the other hand is now pretty straight forward and does
not have any dependencies. It is also very efficient and flexible for small
allocations up to one page. I doubt that switching to a more complex
implementation for these would bring any real benefit. Also since the heaps
can simply be attached to memory ranges, it is easily possible to implement
additional features, like to create allocators tied to CPUs to reduce false
cache line sharing. It would be a simple extension to the current memalign()
function. For this to be useful though, we first need some CPU affinity, so
that threads do not constantly migrate and could actually make use a CPU
specific allocator.

On the large allocation front (bigger than one page) the heap is currently not
that efficient though. It works well, but there are some linear searches
involved that do not scale (though I still have some ideas to speed that up).
So a useful thing for the future would be to move to a &quot;dual allocator&quot;
approach, where the heap is used for all small allocations and a slab or other
allocator for everything else. From my observations, the vast majority of
allocations is in the very small area though, so for large allocations it
could even be argued to simply create areas.

By the way there are now leak checking functions implemented that can track
open allocations and filter by team or thread id (has to be enabled by the
corresponding define at the top of heap.cpp). Also combined with heap tracing
it is possible to easily get the context of allocations to help find out where
the leak started. I found one in BFS this way and hope that it will be useful
to others too.

Regards
Michael
